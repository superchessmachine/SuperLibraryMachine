As with Cole and Kehoe, runs re(cid:31)ect a panic failure to roll over short term loans (as opposed to early withdrawal) and whether these kinds of run equilibria exist depends on macroeconomic fundamentals.1 Some other recent examples of macroeconomic models that consider bank runs include Ennis and Keister (2003), Martin, Skeie, and Von Thadden (2014) and Angeloni and Faia (2013).2 These papers typically incorporate banks with short horizons (e.g. two or 1Our framework thus falls within a general class of macroeconomic models that feature sunspot equilbria to charac- terize business cycles. See for example Farmer (1999). 2See Boissay, Collard, and Smets (2013) for an alternative way to model banking crises that does not involve runs three periods)3. We differ by modeling banks that optimize over an in\ufb01nite horizon. In addition, bank asset liquidation prices are endogenous and affect whether a sunspot bank run equilibrium exists. Section I presents the model and characterizes the equilibria without and with bank runs. For pedagogical purposes, we start with a baseline where bank runs are unan- ticipated. Section II presents a number of numerical experiments to illustrate how the model can capture both standard \ufb01nancial accelerator effects and bank runs, as well as the interaction between the two. In Section III, we describe the extension to the case of anticipated bank runs. Here we present some numerical exercises to illustrate how the mere anticipation of runs can lead to harmful effects on the economy, even if the run does not actually occur. In addition, we show how if we allow for a period of an- ticipation prior to an actual run, the model can produce something like the \"slow run culminating in a fast run\" phenomenon described by Bernanke. We discuss policies that can reduce the likelihood of bank runs in Section IV and directions for further research in the conclusion. The framework is a variation of the in\ufb01nite horizon macroeconomic model with a banking sector and liquidity risks developed in Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011).4 There are two classes of agents - households and bankers - with a continuum of measure unity of each type. Bankers are specialists in making loans and thus intermediate funds between households and productive assets. Households may also make these loans directly, but are less ef\ufb01cient in doing so than banks.", "[2] More recent literature shows that bank runs can also occur even if banks\u2019 assets are fully liquid. Jiang et al. (2024) show that bank runs can also occur as self-fulfilling solvency runs even when banks have fully liquid assets. They provide empirical evidence using a case study from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. They show that \u201cSVB was not an extreme outlier from the perspective of asset losses but was an outlier from the perspective of its liabilities; 92.5% of its deposits were uninsured\u201d, Jiang et al. (2024). Similarly, Amador & Bianchi (2024) also develop a model that shows how bank runs can still occur when banks have only liquid assets, also referring to the failure of SVB as an example where this was the case. Feinstein et al. (2024) show how SVB\u2019s asset composition made it prone to run risk using a framework that captures bank run risk based on balance sheet information. Our approach is related to the model by Liu (2023) which provides a model that combines bank runs and fire sales. In particular, the systemic effect of a bank run is captured by all banks trading in the same illiquid asset, which is also a feature of our model. However, in contrast to our work, the model by Liu (2023) does not include the interbank network and therefore does not model contagion arising in the interbank market and the interplay of contagion in the interbank market and contagion arising from fire sales. There are several game-theoretic approaches to explain bank runs, and also possibly systemic bank runs. For example, Brown et al. (2017) use a game-theoretic framework to analyse under which conditions bank runs at one bank can lead to bank runs at another bank. The role of information plays a key role in this setting and in many other game-theoretic frameworks for contagious bank runs, see also Li & Ma (2022). In our setting, information about market participants etc. can be included in the withdrawal functions both for withdrawals within the network and withdrawals by external depositors. Our work is related to the work by Blickle et al. (2024). They provide empirical evidence based on data from the Great Depression in Germany in 1931 that regular depositors withdraw deposits from all types of banks, whereas \u201cthe interbank market collapses for failing banks entirely but continues to function for surviving banks\u201d. Similarly, P\u00b4erignon et al. (2018) find in an empirical study2 that \u201cdry-ups predict, but do not cause, future deterioration in bank performance\u201d. In particular, they show that mostly low-quality banks suffer from a funding-dry up and argue that this is in contrast to the idea that these dry-ups are random events. These findings highlight the importance of having a modelling framework for funding withdrawal in the interbank market that is flexible enough that it can include this type of behaviour as well. We develop a pecking order model for funding withdrawals that can achieve this.", "[3] We have developed a macroeconomic model to integrate the \"macroeconomic\" ap- proach which stresses \ufb01nancial accelerator effects with the \"microeconomic\" one which stresses bank liquidity mismatch and runs. We illustrated how combining the two ap- proaches is useful for characterizing banking instability. For example, a recession that constrains bank lending due to conventional \ufb01nancial accelerator effects also opens up the possibility of runs due to the associated weakening of balances sheets and reduced liquidity of secondary markets for bank assets. In addition, anticipated bank runs can be harmful even if the runs do not actually occur ex post. Indeed, we argue that allowing for a period of anticipation of a runs prior to an actual run is useful to characterize how the banking distress played out in the Great Recession up to and through the collapse of the shadow banking system. In addition to pursuing aquantitativepolicy analysis, there are two other areas that war- rant further investigation. The \ufb01rst involves modeling beliefs of bank run probabilities. Due to the complexity of our model, we have used a simple reduced form approach that relates the probability of run to the fundamentals that determine the existence of a run equilibrium. It would be useful to explore an alternative approach that tightly ties down beliefs. Secondly, the banks we have modeled correspond best to the lightly regulated shadow banking sector which was at the center of the instability of the recent \ufb01nancial crisis. In doing so we abstracted from the rest of the \ufb01nancial intermediary system. For example, we did not include commercial banks which were tightly regulated and did not experience the same kinds of runs as did the shadow banks. A complete description of the banking crises will require allowing for a richer description of the \ufb01nancial system. This appendix describes the global condition for the bank\u2019s optimization problem un- der anticipated bank runs, as laid out in Section III. We show in particular that the local solution described in the text is in fact a global solution. We show that the bank always has the incentive to raise its leverage to the point where the incentive constraint is bind- ing (equation (22) in the text.) It has no incentive restrict leverage in order to be able to operate in the event of bank run when all other banks have failed. First some preliminaries before turning to the optimization problem: When an indi- vidual bank chooses its leverage multiple \uf0c1t, the payoff to depositors per unit in the next period equals \uf0c1t \uf0c1t \uf0a1 1 is the indicator \uf043", "[4] Modelling contagious bank runs We develop a modelling framework for contagion in financial networks arising from bank runs. We show how interacting channels of contagion, namely funding withdrawals in the interbank network and price-mediated contagion arising from fire sales can turn a bank run on one institution into a systemic crisis. Furthermore, we also model how contagion effects can lead to additional bank runs. Our model allows for a wide range of withdrawal mechanisms both by banks and by external depositors. It can be used for financial stress testing and particularly for analysing implications of different withdrawal mechanisms for systemic risk. We illustrate this in stylised examples and an empirical case study. We find that the extent of systemic risk is highly sensitive to the choices of withdrawal strategies used by the market participants. We also discuss policy implications. Key words: Bank runs, contagion, systemic risk, liquidity freeze, fire sales, financial stress testing. Bank runs pose a significant threat to financial stability. In 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed following a bank run during which more than $40 billion in deposits were withdrawn on one day 1 In SVB\u2019s case, it was estimated that around 94% of its deposits were uninsured at the end of 2022 (Barr, 2023, p. 21). While bank runs can have severe consequences for the market participants directly involved, they can also trigger contagion effects that provide a risk to the financial system and the real economy more widely. Jamilov et al. (2024) show empirically based on data of 308 episodes of bank runs between 1800-2023 that there are significant macroeconomic costs associated with systemic bank runs. The first main contribution of our paper is a model for contagion arising from bank runs. This allows us to quantify the possible systemic nature of a bank run. In our model, the initial shock is a bank run, i.e., depositors withdraw (parts of) their deposits at one or several banks. Hence, the shock hits the liabilities side of a bank\u2019s balance sheet. We assume that banks have liquid assets that they would use first to satisfy any withdrawal requests and hence these liquid assets serve as a buffer that can mitigate the effects of a stress event. If this buffer is not large enough to fully absorb the payment requests, we assume that banks use their interbank assets, 1\u201cOn March 9, SVB lost over $40 billion in deposits, and SVBFG management expected to lose over $100 billion more on March 10. This deposit outflow was remarkable in terms of scale and scope and represented roughly 85 percent of the bank\u2019s deposit base\u201d Barr (2023). The \u201crun on deposits at SVB appears to have been fueled by social media and SVB\u2019s concentrated network of venture capital investors and technology firms that withdrew their deposits in a coordinated manner with unprecedented speed\u201d, (Barr, 2023, p.24)", "[5] There is no doubt that additional features can be incorporated to such studies enriching their mechanisms. Nevertheless our claim is that by targeting the question stream of studies essentially lacked the interacting and shaping forces underlying the banking organization and replaced such forces by a set of simplifying assumptions. It is our belief that the study of systemic risk and contagion in a banking system is an In the remainder of the thesis we focus on the issues of banking, banks runs and the interbank formation and explore how in addressing these issues we essentially develop This chapter constitutes the beginning of the second part of our analysis, in particular the introduction of our agent based model. As stated before, our aim is to derive the necessary forces for a dynamical setup of the interbank market. We start with individuals in a pre-banking society and illustrate how their liquidity needs give rise to banking and also to bank runs. In later chapters we show how these forces evolve giving rise to the interbank market. We start our chapter by introducing the Diamond and Dybvig model [DD00] as a widely used model to understand bank runs and other types of \ufb01nancial crisis. Unlike their model, instead of assuming individuals always join the banks seeking liquidity, we present our society initially with no banks and illustrate how individuals\u2019 heterogeneous needs gave rise to banks. When considering bank operation and the possibility of facing bank runs, we use the same intuition as that of Diamond and Dybvig but adapted to our agent\u2013based model without any a In the early 1980s, Diamond and Dybvig developed a model [DD00] illustrating why banks choose to issue deposits that are more liquid than their assets and why for the same reason banks are subject to runs. According to their model, individuals have a natural demand for liquidity as they are uncertain about when they need to consume and as such for how long they want to hold assets. It provided the \ufb01rst explicit analysis for the liquidity transformation service provided by banks as well as why individuals choose to join banks. The model has 3 times (t = 0,1,2), a single homogeneous consumption good and a productive technology (the illiquid asset) yielding a payo\ufb00 of R > 1 units of output (consumption good) at time t = 2 per unit invested at time t = 0. On the other hand, if the productive technology is liquidated at t = 1 it yields just the initial investment.", "[6] AUTHOR: Omneia R.H. Ismail, M.Sc. (Twente University/ McMaster University ) The aim of this thesis is to study the role of banking in society and the e\ufb00ect of the interbank market on the performance of the banking system. It starts by reviewing several studies conducted on empirical banking networks and highlighting their salient features in the context of modern network theory. A simulated network resembling the characteristics documented in the empirical studies is then built and its resilience is analyzed with a particular emphasis in documenting the crucial role played by highly It is our belief that the study of systemic risk and contagion in a banking system is an integral part to the study of the economic role of banks themselves. Thus the current work focuses on the fundamentals of banking and aims at identifying the Through an agent\u2013based model, we address the issues of bank formation, bank runs and the emergence of an interbank market. Starting with heterogeneous individuals, bank formation is viewed as an emergent phenomenon arising to meet the needs for investment opportunities in face of uncertain liquidity preferences. When banks work bank failures, banking turns into a monopoly or a market with few players. By equipping banks with their own learning tools and allowing an interbank market to develop, fewer bank failures and a less concentrated banking system are witnessed. In addition, through a scenario analysis, it is demonstrated that allowing banks to interact does not weaken the banking system in almost all the cases, and improves The work is concluded by studying the e\ufb00ects of a banking system on individuals and the economy in what is called social measures. We establish that the e\ufb00ects based on the structure of the society.

Now as we allow banks to interact with each other the situation changes signi\ufb01cantly, and our system appears less prone to failures with more market players than witnessed without an interbank In Figure 6.3 we show four independent simulations of our model where banks were allowed to establish links, with parameters c1= 1.1, c2 =1.5, r = 0.5, R = 2, \u03b1 = 0.7 and Rmin = 0.1. Compared to the cases of no interbank links, we see that more players (banks) are thriving in our society. We see that 2 banks were successfully established out of total 33 banks that tried throughout the society history in the \ufb01rst Figure 6.3: Established banks in a 100 with interbank market For more conclusive results we implemented 50 independent simulations1 of the without interbank links (see Appendix (A.1) for the numerical results). In Figure 6.4 below we report the histograms of the number of banks that survived at the end of the simulation for both cases. As we see there is a clear di\ufb00erence in the distribution market players in the case of no interbank market compared to that where banks were allowed to cooperate. For example, we see fewer monopolies developing in the case of interbank market. On a closer look to the data we \ufb01nd that the number of times when a bank becomes dominant in the society (i.e having more than 90% of 1For the numerical comparisons we counted on samples of size 50 independent simulations.

Figure 6.4: Histogram of number of banks established by the end of the 80-th period for the 50 simulations, interbank case (upper graph) and no interbank case (lower graph). In our inquiry to examine the di\ufb00erences we compared the results along three criteria we deemed to re\ufb02ect the basic status of the banking in the society: (i) the", "[9] Acemoglu et al. (2021) also model a credit freeze, but the motivation in their model is that banks withdraw funding in anticipation of a future default, i.e., they do not lend because they worry that they will not be repaid and not because they suffer a liquidity stress. This is in contrast to our setting in which banks reduce lending because they themselves are under stress. Our work also contributes to the already very rich literature on bank runs. There are two classical views on why bank runs occur (Allen & Gale, 1998): First, they can be random events or self-fulling prophecies, see e.g., Diamond & Dybvig (1983). Second, they can be part of the business cycle Allen & Gale (1998) or problematic macroeconomic fundamentals Bryant (1980). Diamond & Dybvig (1983) have outlined in their pioneering work on bank runs how the maturity transformation that banks provide makes them vulnerable to bank runs. In particular, banks typically provide long-term loans that are funded by short-term deposits. If depositors withdraw their deposits in large quantities, a bank might not have enough liquid assets to satisfy the withdrawal requests by its depositors. Diamond & Dybvig (1983) show that there are multiple equilibria, one of which is a bank run. A bank run is then the outcome of a coordination failure or can also be considered as a self-fulfilling prophecy. This part of the literature does not consider the possible systemic component of a bank run. More recent literature shows that bank runs can also occur even if banks\u2019 assets are fully liquid. Jiang et al. (2024) show that bank runs can also occur as self-fulfilling solvency runs even when banks have fully liquid assets. They provide empirical evidence using a case study from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. They show that \u201cSVB was not an extreme outlier from the perspective of asset losses but was an outlier from the perspective of its liabilities; 92.5% of its deposits were uninsured\u201d, Jiang et al. (2024). Similarly, Amador & Bianchi (2024) also develop a model that shows how bank runs can still occur when banks have only liquid assets, also referring to the failure of SVB as an example where this was the case. Feinstein et al. (2024) show how SVB\u2019s asset composition made it prone to run risk using a framework that captures bank run risk based on balance sheet information.", "[10] Our third contribution is the introduction of several tractable measures to assess the con- sequences of initial bank runs. This allows us to analyse and compare different mitigating strategies that banks might use. These measures can also be used as a tool for financial reg- ulation, e.g., to assess and design liquidity buffers, deposit insurance, liquidity provision by a lender of last resort, etc. Our paper is structured as follows. In Subsection 1.1 we discuss relevant related literature. In Section 2 we propose a general model for contagion arising from bank runs. In Section 3 we provide specific examples for withdrawal mechanisms both within the financial network and for withdrawals by external depositors. In Section 4 we introduce several measures that can be used to quantify the level of distress in the system. In particular, we introduce a traffic light measure that quantifies the proportion of nodes in various states of distress. In Section 5 we illustrate how our model can be used for financial stress testing. We provide one stylised example and an example based on empirical data that are publicly available from the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Finally, Section 6 concludes. The appendix contains all the proofs in Section A and we provide descriptive statistics and more details on the empirical data in Section B. Our paper contributes to the literature on systemic risk in financial networks. While a large part of this literature considers how losses spread through the system, i.e., they spread from borrowers to lenders, see e.g. Eisenberg & Noe (2001), Rogers & Veraart (2013), Cifuentes et al. (2005), Amini et al. (2016a), Battiston et al. (2012), Glasserman & Young (2015) and the survey by Glasserman & Young (2016), we focus on funding withdrawals, i.e., lenders stop lending and hence contagion (in the form of liquidity need) spreads from lenders to borrowers. In contrast to contagion from borrowers to lenders where bankruptcy law determines how contagion spreads, contagion from lenders to borrowers is not subject to formal rules but is determined by preferences of individual institutions. This gives rise to greater flexibility when modelling the contagion process. Mathematically, we will see that there are many similarities in deriving an equilibrium in a setting where the direction of contagion is reversed, but the richer set of rules of possible contagion processes can result in very different outcomes for the system. We will therefore consider different types of strategies that market participants can apply in times of deposit withdrawals, and we study the consequences for the system.", "[11] society (each highlighted with di\ufb00erent colour) where most of the individuals (about 78%) in the society joined banks at the end. In the next section we consider the more general case where banks face the con- misestimation of their depositors\u2019 needs. Vulnerable to runs, banks need to learn and adapt to survive. Figure 5.3: Banks established after 80 periods in a society of 6400 individuals, without the possibility of a bank run. In the Diamond and Dybvig model [DD00], as well as many models following their footsteps, a bank run occurs when the face value of the deposits becomes higher than the expected value of waiting to withdraw at a later time. Speci\ufb01cally, the bank run is an equilibrium state in which all depositors (impatient as well as patient agents) withdraw at the intermediate time step because they expect all the others to do the individuals is higher than the expected value of waiting to withdraw at next time step. Accordingly not only impatient depositors withdraw at the intermediate time step (as to be expected by the bank), but so do patient depositors, causing a run in We now consider a more realistic version of our model where banks face the possi- bility of failure using the same intuition as that of Diamond and Dybvig, but adapted Once a bank chooses their estimated proportion of early customers W i k and makes the resource allocation at the beginning of the investing period t2k according to 5.3, it faces the actual ratio W i k of impatient individuals at t2k+1. Two scenarios can k): If the actual proportion is higher than the one based on which the bank made its investment, the bank faces a liquidity problem. Denoting by Ni k the number of customers the bank has at period k, it needs to raise an amount equal to c1(W i k to meet the excess demand for liquidity at time t2k+1. For this, the bank \ufb01rst attempts to use its own accumulated reserves (denoted as Ri customers, that is, if Ri k). If these are enough to satisfy all early W i k, then the bank \ufb01nds itself in the fortunate situation of having less late customers than previously anticipated. The amount left over is then added to the realized reserves for period k, that is, On the other hand, if the accumulated reserves are not enough to cover the shortfall at time t2k+1, that is if Ri", "[12] on actual network structures as a starting point in examining the system stability, provided a rather static picture of the system as manifested by knocking one bank at a time and examining the domino e\ufb00ect, if any, on the network. Such an approach, while providing the \ufb02exibility of examining the network, neglected the dynamical nature of the system where banks as well as individual depositors a\ufb00ect each other, In addition, the approach lacked the motivating forces motives for banks to interact with each other. Rather the approach imposed a set of simplifying assumptions to compensate for the lack of such forces, such as the mechanical nature of bank failures by knocking them down and the zero recovery rates associated with their failure. On the other hand we \ufb01nd that theoretical studies such as that of Allen and Gale [AG98], by employing an economist\u2019s intuition in addressing bank failures and bank interaction, provided the interacting forces that the empirical based studies lacked. Nevertheless, theoretical studies building on assumptions of optimized behaviour as well as restricting network topologies hindered their generalization to more relevant settings or di\ufb00erent network structures. Between the static picture provided by the empirically based studies and the simpli\ufb01ed and constrained picture of the theoretical studies, the underlying theory of banking systems implicitly or explicitly re\ufb02ected an unrealistic picture of a manageable and predictable organization. We believe the more appropriate call for the banking theory is to combine the contributions of both streams, the \ufb02exibility of the empirical based studies and the quest to understand the underlying dynamical forces in theoretically based studies, in a new direction of Two core modi\ufb01cations to the assumptions of orthodox economic theory have re- cently been proposed, helping pave the way for such new directions of research. The \ufb01rst is an emphasis on inductive rather than deductive thinking. The deductive ap- proach for economic analysis has long been argued against by many economists given that our rationality is essentially bounded (the notion of bounded rationality goes back to Nobel prize laureate Herbert Simon in the 1950s [Sim55]). Recently, it has been explicitly argued that inductive reasoning (as put forward in the El Farol prob- lem by Arthur [Art94]) gives a proper candidate approach or model for our decision making. That approach implied a learning, adaptive process through which market participants form hypotheses given their set of information and experiences, test the", "[13] 1\uf03a It can does so \uf043 1, and second by reducing the leverage In sum, an increase in the perceived likelihood of a bank run has harmful effects on the economy even if a bank run does not materialize. It does so by causing bank credit to contract, partly by reducing the maximum leverage ratio and partly by causing aggregate net worth to shrink due to an increased deposit rate. We next turn to the issue of how the probability depositors assign to a bank run is determined. In principle, a way to determine to pin down the probability of a run is to use the global games approach developed by Morris and Shin (1998) and applied to bank runs by Goldstein and Pauzner (2005). Under this approach, the run probabilities are tied to the fundamentals of the economy and a bank run is unique equilibrium outcome as opposed to being the product of a sunspot. Given the complexities involved, however, this approach has been limited largely to very simple two period models as opposed to an in\ufb01nite horizon general equilibrium framework like ours. Instead we follow the spirit of the global games approach by postulating a reduced form that relates pt to the aggregate recovery rate xt, which is the key fundamental determining whether a bank run equilibrium exists.18 In particular we assume that the probability depositors assign to a bank run happening in the subsequent period is a decreasing function of the expected recovery rate, as follows To be clear, under this formulation a bank run remains a sunspot outcome. However the probability pt of the \"sunspot\" depends in a natural way on the fundamental xt 1\uf03a In the numerical simulations that follow, we assume that g takes the following simple linear form: The dependency of the bank run probability on the recovery rate works to amplify the effects of aggregate disturbances to the economy, even beyond the ampli\ufb01cation that comes from the conventional \ufb01nancial accelerator. We illustrate this point with numerical simulations. We stick with the same calibration as in our baseline case (see Table 1). But we now allow for individuals to anticipate a run with probability pt, as determined by In addition, we suppose that if a run does occur, individuals still use equation (39). the same method to determine the likelihood of a subsequent run as the banking system recovers after the run. Figure 5 reports the impulse responses to a negative shock to Zt for the case where pt responds endogenously, given by the solid line in each panel. To isolate the effect of the anticipation of the run, we suppose in this case that the run never actually occurs ex post. For comparison, the dotted lines reports the responses of the economy in the case where individuals attach zero probability of a bank run (as portrayed in Figure 3).", "[14] shape nor the type of such a network. For such extension, larger societies need to be considered, coupled with the possibility of multiple bank establishments at the same period in such large societies (as in our model we are restricted to the possibility of only one bank establishment at a time). Is our model or another version of it capable of delivering an interbank network that actually resembles a scale\u2013free one? If that is the case, we can then use it to ful\ufb01ll one of the main motivating goals of agent\u2013based models in general, namely that of serving as a \u201cpetri dish\u201d simulation of an actual banking system, upon which one can test the e\ufb00ects of many real life policies and interventions.

Classi\ufb01er system and ge-", "[15] To date, most macroeconomic models which have tried to capture the effects of bank- ing distress have emphasized \ufb01nancial accelerator effects, but have not adequately cap- tured bank runs. Most models of bank runs, however, are typically quite stylized and not suitable for quantitative analysis. Further, often the runs are not connected to fundamen- tals. That is, they may be equally likely to occur in good times as well as bad. Our goal is to develop a simple macroeconomic model of banking instability that fea- tures both \ufb01nancial accelerator effects and bank runs. Our approach emphasizes the complementary nature of these mechanisms. Balance sheet conditions not only affect the cost of bank credit, they also affect whether runs are possible. In this respect one can relate the possibility of runs to macroeconomic conditions and in turn characterize how runs feed back into the macroeconomy. For simplicity, we consider an in\ufb01nite horizon economy with a \ufb01xed supply of capital, along with households and bankers. It is not dif\ufb01cult to map the framework into a more conventional macroeconomic model with capital accumulation and employment (cid:31)uctu- ations. The economy with a \ufb01xed endowment and a \ufb01xed supply of capital, however, allows us to characterize in a fairly tractable way how banking distress and bank runs affect the behavior of asset prices and credit costs. It is then straightforward to infer the implications of the resulting \ufb01nancial distress for aggregate economic activity in a setting with variable investment and employment. As in Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011), endogenous pro- cyclical movements in bank balance sheets lead to countercyclical movements in the cost of bank credit. At the same time, due to liquidity mismatch, bank runs may be possible. Whether or not a bank run equilibrium exists will depend on two key factors: the condition of bank balance sheets and an endogenously determined asset liquidation price. Thus, a situation can arise where a bank run cannot occur in normal times, but where a severe recession can open up the possibility. Though our modeling of runs as products of liquidity mismatch in bank portfolios is in the spirit of Diamond and Dybvig, our technical approach follows more closely Cole and Kehoe\u2019s (2000) model of self-ful\ufb01lling debt crises. As with Cole and Kehoe, runs re(cid:31)ect a panic failure to roll over short term loans (as opposed to early withdrawal) and whether these kinds of run equilibria exist depends on macroeconomic fundamentals.1"], "final_answer": "Main computational approaches used to study bank-run phenomena fall in four broad groups.  \n\n1.

Network-based contagion & stress-testing frameworks  \n   \u2022 Methodology  \n     \u2013 A financial network is represented as a directed graph of interbank liabilities; simulations iterate two contagion channels: (i) funding withdrawals on the liability side, (ii) price-mediated fire-sale losses on the asset side [4].  \n     \u2013 Multiple withdrawal rules can be plugged in, allowing scenario analysis and stress-testing on real data (e.g. SVB case) [4, 10].  \n   \u2022 Entities & relationships  \n     Banks (nodes) + external depositors; edges = interbank claims; regulators can be added as liquidity providers.  \n   \u2022 Indicators  \n     Traffic-light distress measure (share of banks in green/amber/red states), number of defaults, volume of fire-sales, systemic-liquidity shortfall [10].  \n   \u2022 Temporal design  \n     Discrete multi-period or event-driven until the balance-sheet fixed point is reached; experiments include single-bank runs, multi-bank shocks, and alternative withdrawal strategies [4].  \n\n3. Agent-based models (ABM) of banking formation and runs  \n   \u2022 Methodology  \n     \u2013 Bottom-up simulation where heterogeneous individuals decide whether to found or join banks; banks learn withdrawal probabilities, allocate assets, and may form interbank links; runs follow a Diamond\u2013Dybvig logic implemented at the agent level [5, 11].  \n     \u2013 Algorithms use inductive learning rules and evolutionary selection of surviving banks; repeated Monte-Carlo experiments compare economies with/without interbank markets [8].  \n   \u2022 Entities & links  \n     Individuals (depositors/investors) \u2194 Banks (balance sheets, learning) \u2194 Interbank network that emerges endogenously [6, 12].  \n   \u2022 Metrics  \n     Number of banks created/surviving, frequency of monopolies, incidence and timing of bank failures, client coverage, inequality measures [8].  \n   \u2022 Temporal scope  \n     80-period (or longer) simulations, with scenarios such as periodic liquidity shocks, community structure, or policy interventions [8, 14].  \n\n4.
