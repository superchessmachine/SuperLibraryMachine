OTUB1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that cleaves Lys-48– linked polyubiquitin chains and also regulates ubiquitin signal- ingthroughaunique,noncatalyticmechanism.OTUB1bindsto a subset of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and inhibits their activity by trapping the E2(cid:2)ubiquitin thioester and preventing ubiquitintransfer.ThesamesetofE2sstimulatethedeubiquiti- nating activity of OTUB1 when the E2 is not charged with ubiq- uitin.Previousstudieshaveshownthat,incells,OTUB1bindsto E2-conjugating enzymes of the UBE2D (UBCH5) and UBE2E families, as well as to UBE2N (UBC13). Cellular roles have been identified for the interaction of OTUB1 with UBE2N and mem- bers of the UBE2D family, but not for interactions with UBE2E E2 enzymes. We report here a novel role for OTUB1–E2 inter- actions in modulating E2 protein ubiquitination. We observe that Otub1(cid:2)/(cid:2) knockout mice exhibit late-stage embryonic lethality. We find that OTUB1 depletion dramatically destabi- lizes the E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2E1 (UBCH6) in both mouse and human OTUB1 knockout cell lines. Of note, this effect is independent of the catalytic activity of OTUB1, but depends on its ability to bind to UBE2E1. We show that OTUB1 suppresses UBE2E1 autoubiquitination in vitro and in cells, thereby preventing UBE2E1 from being targeted to the protea- somefordegradation.Takentogether,weprovideevidencethat OTUB1 rescues UBE2E1 from degradation in vivo.
Ubiquitinsignalingplaysanessentialroleinnearlyallaspects of eukaryotic biology. Substrate ubiquitination is tightly regu- lated temporally and in response to different stimuli through the opposing actions of enzymes that attach and remove ubiq- uitinfromsubstrateproteins.Ubiquitinisconjugatedtolysines via E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases, resulting in an isopeptide linkagebetweentheubiquitinCterminusandasubstratelysine
or, in some cases, with the substrate N terminus (1, 2). Polyu- biquitin chains can be homopolymers that are linked through oneofubiquitin’ssevenlysinesoritsN-terminalmethionine,or heterotypic chains that contain a mixture of linkages (1, 3). The ubiquitinmodificationisreversedbydeubiquitinatingenzymes (DUBs),3 which remove ubiquitin from proteins and cleave polyubiquitin chains (4, 5), thus terminating a ubiquitin signal- ingeventandrecyclingubiquitinmonomers.The(cid:2)90DUBsin humancellsfallintosixclassesbasedoncatalyticdomainarchi- tecture: ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases, ubiquitin-specific proteases, ovarian tumor domain containing proteases (OTU), Machado–Joseph domain proteases, JAB1/MPN/Mov34 (JAMM) metalloproteases, and the recently discovered MIU-containing DUB family, MINDY (4, 6).
OTUB1isanOTUclasscysteineprotease(7)thatspecifically cleaves Lys-48–linked polyubiquitin chains (8, 9) and is one of the most abundant human DUBs (10). OTUB1 has been shown to regulate a diverse set of cellular processes through its deu- biquitinating activity. Among the proteins that OTUB1 stabi- lizes are the transcription factors, FOXM1 (11) and ER(cid:2)(12), and the small GTPase, RhoA (13). OTUB1 also deubiquitinates some E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as c-IAP1, a regulator of NF-(cid:3)B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (14), TRAF3 and TRAF6, regulators of virus-triggered interferon induction (15), and GRAIL, which regulates T-cell anergy (16). In addition to its deubiquitinating activity, OTUB1 has the unique ability to bind to a subset of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and inhibit ubiquitin transfer in a manner that does not depend upon the catalytic activity of OTUB1 (17–19). Dur- ing the double strand break response, OTUB1 binds to UBE2N and suppresses synthesis of Lys-63–linked polyubiquitin at DNA double strand breaks, thereby regulating the DNA dam- age response (17). OTUB1 inhibits UBE2N by binding to the charged E2(cid:2)Ub thioester intermediate and preventing ubiqui- tin transfer (17, 19, 20). OTUB1 has also been shown to non- catalytically inhibit UBCH5 in vitro (18) and in cells (21). In other examples of noncatalytic inhibition, OTUB1 stabilizes p53 by inhibiting UBCH5/MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of

Mass spectrometry studies have revealed that OTUB1 can form complexes with several other E2s in cells, including UBE2E1 (UBCH6), UBE2E2 (UBCH8), and UBE2E3 (UBCH9), in addition to UBE2N (UBC13) and the UBCH5 (UBE2D1,-2,and-3)isoforms(17,27).WhentheE2partnersof OTUB1 are not charged with ubiquitin, E2 binding to OTUB1 stimulates its Lys-48–specific deubiquitinating activity (28), althoughthephysiologicalroleofthisstimulationremainstobe shown.
UBE2E1 has been identified as a binding partner of OTUB1 by MS analysis of OTUB1 binding partners in cells (17) and becauseitstimulatesthedeubiquitinatingactivityofOTUB1in vitro (28). UBE2E1 is a class III E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that belongs to the UBE2E family of E2s, comprising UBE2E1/UBCH6, UBE2E2/UBCH8, and UBE2E3/UBCH9 (29). UBE2E family members share a highly conserved UBC domain but are distinguished from one another by their unique N-terminal extensions. These N-terminal extensions are sites for intramolecular autoubiquitination in vitro, which has been shown to limit the catalytic activity of UBE2E family E2s (30, 31).WhenlysineresidueswithintheirNterminiaremutatedto arginine, or their N termini are deleted entirely, UBE2E E2s switch from primarily monoubiquitination of substrates to robust polyubiquitination (30, 31). There are several reports on the cellular functions and substrates of UBE2E1. In cells, UBE2E family E2s are imported into the nucleus when charged with ubiquitin (32). In addition to its ubiquitin-conjugating activity, UBE2E1 can also act as an ISG15-conjugating enzyme in vitro, although this activity has not been shown to occur in vivo(33).UBE2E1canbecovalentlymodifiedwitheitherISG15 or ubiquitin, both of which interfere with the ubiquitin-conju- gating activity of UBE2E1 (30, 33). UBE2E1 has also been reported to monoubiquitinate histone H2A at Lys-119 in con- cert with the PRC1 E3 ligase complex (34).
We report here a novel role for OTUB1 in maintaining E2 levels in cells. We find that Otub1-deficient (Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4)) mice exhibit late embryonic lethality. Proteomic analysis of Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4)mouseembryonicfibroblasts(MEFs)showsthatlev- els of the E2, UBE2E1, are dramatically lower in the absence of OTUB1. In U2OS cells, knockdown or knockout of OTUB1 similarly leads to dramatically lower levels of UBE2E1 protein. This regulation of UBE2E1 stability depends on the ability of OTUB1 to bind to UBE2E1 but does not depend upon OTUB1 catalyticactivity.WeshowthatUBE2E1isubiquitinatedinvivo and that in the absence of OTUB1, UBE2E1 is targeted to the proteasome for degradation. In vitro, UBE2E1 is autoubiquiti- nated in both the presence and absence of an E3 ligase, but this autoubiquitination activity is suppressed by OTUB1. Taken together, our data suggest that OTUB1 protects UBE2E1 from degradation by inhibiting E2 autoubiquitination activity. These observations reveal a novel role for OTUB1 binding to E2 ubiq- uitin-conjugating enzymes in regulating E2 stability within the cell.

DeletionofOTUB1causeslatestageembryoniclethalityin mice
OTUB1isthemostabundantDUBinmouseandhumancells and is present at concentrations of about 1 (cid:5)M (10). To gain insight into the function of OTUB1 in vivo, we generated Otub1(cid:3)/(cid:4) mice by gene targeting in C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells(Fig.S1,AandB).HeterozygousOtub1(cid:3)/(cid:4)micewerethen interbredtostudythephenotypiceffectsofOtub1deficiencyin vivo. We screened 124 live born mice and found that 35% were Otub1(cid:3)/(cid:3), 65% were heterozygous Otub1(cid:3)/(cid:4), and 0% were homozygous Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4) mice (Table 1). As we found no live born Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4) mice, we sacrificed pregnant females from timed matings of Otub1(cid:3)/(cid:4) mice at day 14.5 of gestation, and genotyped the E14.5 embryos. These analyses revealed that the mutant Otub1(cid:4) allele segregated in perfect Mendelian ratio (1:2:1) among 110 embryos (Table 1). These results indicate that Otub1 deficiency causes lethality in the late stages of embryonic development. We then used E14.5 embryos to gen- erate Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4) and control MEFs.
DepletionofOTUB1destabilizesUBE2E1
We took advantage of the ability to generate Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4) null MEFs to search for proteins whose stability depends on the presence of OTUB1. Thus far, there are only a handful of pro- teins whose stability is known to be regulated by OTUB1, the majority by a noncatalytic mechanism (21, 25, 26). We used tandem mass tag MS (35) to search for proteins whose stability was altered in the absence of OTUB1. Proteins were extracted from both WT and Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4) knockout MEF and then modi- fied with tandem mass tags prior to digestion with trypsin and LC–MS analysis. A volcano plot of the relative changes in pro- tein abundance in knockout versus WT cells (Fig. 1A) revealed that levels of several E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are lower in Otub1 knockout cells, including UBE2E1/UBCH6, UBE2E2/UBCH8, UBE2C/UBCH10, UBE2S, and UBE2D3/ UBCH5C. The most dramatic and statistically significant effect was on UBE2E1, which is known to bind to OTUB1 in cells (17, 27). Levels of UBE2C were also much lower in OTUB1 knock- out cells, but this E2 is not known to bind to OTUB1 in vivo or in vitro. A handful of proteins were enriched upon the loss of OTUB1 (Fig. S2 and Table S1), but none are verified targets of either OTUB1 or UBE2E1 in vivo. Further study may clarify whether these enriched proteins are direct OTUB1 or UBE2E1 substrates.
We focused on the effect of OTUB1 deletion on UBE2E1 levels because of its reported association with OTUB1 in cells (17,27).ToconfirmtheMSresults,weusedimmunoblottingto compare steady-state levels of UBE2E1 in whole cell lysates of

OTUB1 by siRNA. The expression of siRNA-resistant FLAG- OTUB1 restores UBE2E1 protein levels when OTUB1 is knocked down (Fig. 2C). UBE2E1 protein levels could also be restored in OTUB1 CRISPR knockout cell lines by expressing eitherFLAG-OTUB1oruntaggedOTUB1(Fig.2D).Tofurther test whether OTUB1 stabilizes UBE2E1, we overexpressed FLAG-OTUB1 in U2OS cells and probed for UBE2E1. As shown in Fig. 2E, overexpression of OTUB1 significantly enhanced the steady-state levels of UBE2E1 (Fig. 2E). By con- trast,levelsofUBCH5wereunaffectedwhenOTUB1wasover- expressed (Fig. 2E). Taken together, our results confirm that OTUB1 specifically regulates the stability of the E2 ubiquitin- conjugating enzyme, UBE2E1.

WT and Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4) knockout MEFs (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the MS results (Fig. 1A), we observed markedly lower UBE2E1 protein levels in Otub1(cid:4)/(cid:4) MEFs as compared with WT cells (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the Otub1 knockout has a minimal effect on the levels of UBCH5 (UBE2D; all isoforms) and no effect on UBC13 (UBE2N) (Fig. 1B), two known binding partners of OTUB1 in cells (17, 27).
To ascertain whether the effect on UBE2E1 levels of an Otub1 deletion was specific to MEFs, we used CRISPR-Cas9 (36, 37) to knock out OTUB1 gene expression in human osteo- sarcoma(U2OS)cells.AsshowninFig.2A,UBE2E1levelswere dramatically reduced in the U2OS knockout. To verify that the reduced UBE2E1 levels were not an adaptation to the absence of OTUB1, we used siRNA to transiently knock down OTUB1 expression in U2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, siRNA knock- downofOTUB1expressionsimilarlyreducedlevelsofUBE2E1 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that OTUB1 regulates UBE2E1 stability and that this regulation is not spe- cific to a particular cell type.
As has been observed in previous studies (34, 38, 39), the anti-UBE2E1 antibody (see “Materials and methods”) reacts with three different molecular weight bands in Western blots (Fig. 1). The middle band corresponds to the canonical UBE2E1, as can be seen by a comparison with recombinant UBE2E1 (Fig. S3A). The remaining cross-reacting bands are also E2 enzymes, as they migrate as higher molecular weight species in whole cell extracts prepared under conditions that preserve the thioester linkages (28, 40) (Fig. S3B), consistent with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity. The upper band migrates at the expected molecular weight of UBE2E2 and UBE2E3, as confirmed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against those isoforms (Fig. S3C). Knockdown of OTUB1 has little to no effect on either of these isoforms (Fig. S3C), suggesting that all three bands may represent splice vari- ants of UBE2E1.
ExpressionofWTorcatalyticallyinactiveOTUB1restores UBE2E1levels
To confirm that OTUB1 directly regulates the stability of UBE2E1, we generated stable cell lines expressing siRNA- resistant FLAG-OTUB1 and knocked down endogenous
To test whether the catalytic activity of OTUB1 is required for its regulation of UBE2E1 levels, we assayed the ability of OTUB1 mutants defective in noncatalytic inhibition to com- plementsiRNAknockdownofendogenousOTUB1expression. Substitution of the active site cysteine with serine (C91S) inac- tivates OTUB1 (9), whereas a T134R substitution abrogates OTUB1 binding to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (18, 28), thereby disrupting the ability of OTUB1 to prevent ubiquitin transfer. As shown in Fig. 2F, expression of a catalytic mutant, FLAG-OTUB1C91S, restores levels of UBE2E1, whereas expres- sion of OTUB1T134R, fails to restore WT levels of UBE2E1 (Fig. 2F).WethereforeconcludethatOTUB1regulatesUBE2E1lev- els through the previously reported ability of OTUB1 to bind to E2enzymes(18–20),andnotasaconsequenceofOTUB1DUB activity.
OTUB1rescuesUBE2E1fromproteasomaldegradation
Because previous studies had identified a role for OTUB1 in stabilizing the transcription factor FOXM1 in cells (11), we considered the possibility that OTUB1 may regulate UBE2E1 protein levels at the level of transcription. We extracted total mRNA from WT U2OS cells, a CRISPR OTUB1 knockout, and siRNA OTUB1 knockdown cells and compared transcript lev- els for OTUB1 and UBE2E1 to that of TATA box-binding pro- tein(TBP).UBE2E1transcriptlevelsarenotaffectedbyOTUB1 knockout or knockdown (Fig. S4), indicating that OTUB1 does not regulate UBE2E1 levels at the level of transcription.
TotestmoredirectlywhetherOTUB1stabilizestheUBE2E1 protein, we treated cells with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis and monitored UBE2E1 stability in siRNA knock- down versus control cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, UBE2E1 is rap- idlydegradedwhenendogenousOTUB1expressionisknocked down. Quantification of the canonical UBE2E1 protein band revealedthatithasashorterhalf-lifecomparedwiththecontrol cells(Fig.3B).However,expressionofFLAG-OTUB1stabilized UBE2E1 in OTUB1-depleted cells. To test whether UBE2E1 is degraded by the proteasome, we treated cells with the protea- some inhibitor, MG132, and compared steady-state levels of UBE2E1 in cells in which OTUB1 expression was knocked down by siRNA as compared with cells transfected with siRNA control. As shown in Fig. 3C, UBE2E1 levels increase in the OTUB1knockdowncellsafter2hofMG132treatmentascom- pared with cells treated with DMSO.

somal degradation through the ability of OTUB1 to noncata- lytically inhibit E2 enzymes (18–20).
OTUB1inhibitsUBE2E1autoubiquitination
In previous studies in which OTUB1 has been shown to sta- bilize a substrate through its noncatalytic activity, OTUB1 inhibits the activity of an E2 that conjugates Lys-48–linked polyubiquitin to the substrate (21–26). Because UBE2E1 is known to bind OTUB1 (17), this raises the possibility that OTUB1 may stabilize UBE2E1 directly by forming an OTUB1– UBE2E1 complex. Although it has been demonstrated that UBE2E1 can stimulate OTUB1 DUB activity (28), it has not been shown whether OTUB1 inhibits UBE2E1 in the manner observed for UBE2N/UBC13, UBE2D2, and UBE2D3 (17, 18, 20). Recently, UBE2E1 was shown to autoubiquitinate itself in vitro in the presence or absence of the E3 ligase, RNF4 (30, 31), raising the possibility that OTUB1 may stabilize UBE2E1 by preventing autoubiquitination.
To test the hypothesis that OTUB1 may directly inhibit UBE2E1, we assayed the autoubiquitinating activity of UBE2E1 in the presence and absence of OTUB1 in vitro. In the absence ofanE3ligase,UBE2E1primarilymonoubiquitinatesitself(Fig. 4, top panel). Addition of the E3 ligase RNF4 stimulates synthe- sis of polyubiquitin chains by UBE2E1 (Fig. 4, top and middle panel). Immunoblotting with an antibody specific for UBE2E1 showssmearscharacteristicofpolyubiquitinchainsattachedto UBE2E1, whereas immunoblotting with an antibody specific for Lys-48–linked polyubiquitin shows the presence of higher molecular weight Lys-48–linked polyubiquitin (Fig. 4, bottom panel). The Lys-48 chains may either be anchored to UBE2E1 or RNF4, although we cannot rule out the possibility that RNF4 stimulatesUBE2E1toformfreeLys-48–linkedchains.Catalyt- ically inactive OTUB1C91S completely inhibits UBE2E1 ubiq- uitination activity in both the presence and absence of E3 (Fig. 4, top panel). These results confirm that OTUB1 can noncata- lytically inhibit UBE2E1 as has been observed for UBE2N and UBCH5 isoforms (17–20).
Although it is not known whether RNF4 stimulates UBE2E1 in vivo, our in vitro results raised the interesting possibility that OTUB1 could inhibit UBE2E1 autoubiquitination in cells, thereby accounting for the ability of OTUB1 to prevent UBE2E1 from being targeted to the proteasome. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected U2OS cells with plasmids expressing HA-tagged UBE2E1 and His6-tagged ubiquitin, and then treated the cells with MG132 to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins. His6-tagged ubiquitinated proteins were pulled down by Ni2(cid:3)-NTA resin under denaturing conditions and the resultsanalyzedbyWesternblotswereprobedwithananti-HA antibody. We found that HA-UBE2E1 is primarily monoubiq- uitinated in cells, with a small amount of higher molecular weight bands also observed (Fig. 5A). To determine whether monoubiquitination of UBE2E1 in cells is due to autoubiq- uitination activity, we compared autoubiquitination of WT HA-UBE2E1 and a catalytically inactive mutant HA- UBE2E1C131A under the same experimental conditions as described above. As shown in Fig. 5B, WT HA-UBE2E1 is the catalytically inactive mutant ubiquitinated but not HA-UBE2E1C131A, supporting the idea that UBE2E1 is

HistoneubiquitinationisnotaffectedbyOTUB1orUBE2E1
UBE2E1 has been reported to monoubiquitinate histone H2A at Lys-119 (34), a histone mark that regulates gene silenc- ing (42). In light of our observation that the absence of OTUB1 destabilizes UBE2E1, we tested whether decreased cellular lev- els of OTUB1 reduce ubiquitination of H2A Lys-119. However, we find no detectable difference in levels of ubiquitinated H2A whenOTUB1isknockeddownbysiRNAinU2OScells(Fig.6A and Fig. S5A), or in a CRISPR-Cas9 OTUB1 knockout cell line (Fig. 6B and Fig. S5B). As a control to rule out possible indirect effects impacting H2A ubiquitination levels, we used siRNA to knock down expression of UBE2E1 directly and examined the

steady-statelevelsofubiquitinatedH2A.Contrarytoaprevious report (34), we did not find that UBE2E1 siRNA knockdown affected ubiquitination of H2A Lys-119 (Fig. 6C and Fig. S5C). We similarly found that a UBE2E1 knockdown did not impact histone H2B monoubiquitination (Fig. 6C), a mark of actively transcribed chromatin (43). Although we cannot rule out addi- tional factors that may account for the lack of an effect of UBE2E1 or OTUB1 knockdown on histone H2A monoubiq- uitination, we note that the RING1B/BMI1 E3 ligase complex that monoubiquitinates H2A Lys-119 also ubiquitinates H2A togetherwiththeE2,UBCH5C(44,45),whichmaycompensate for the absence of UBE2E1 in our experiments. Our results are
therefore more consistent with a role for UBCH5C, rather than UBE2E1, in monoubiquitinating H2A Lys-119.
Discussion
The ability of OTUB1 to bind to E2 enzymes and inhibit ubiquitintransferinamannerthatdoesnotdependonOTUB1 catalytic activity was first discovered in studies of DNA damage signaling, in which OTUB1 inhibits the E2, UBE2N/UBC13 (17).OTUB1wasalsoshowntobindtomembersoftheUBE2D and UBE2E E2 families, although the in vivo significance of that observation was not known (17, 20, 28). Subsequent studies

haveshownthatOTUB1stabilizesproteinssuchasp53(21,22), SMAD2/3 (25), and DEPTOR (26) in a noncatalytic manner by preventing transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 to the substrate. TheE2thatubiquitinatesthesesubstratesintransisthoughtto belong to the UBE2D (UBCH5) family, based on the promiscu- ous activity of these E2 enzymes with most E3 ligases and the ability of OTUB1 to inhibit members of this family (17, 18). In thisstudy,weshowthatOTUB1stabilizesUBE2E1(UBCH6)in a unique manner by preventing this E2 from ubiquitinating its own lysines, thereby protecting UBE2E1 from proteasomal degradation.
The ability of OTUB1 to suppress UBE2E1 autoubiquitina- tion explains why knockdown or knockout of OTUB1 dramat- ically stabilizes UBE2E1 protein levels but has little to no effect on levels of other E2 partners of OTUB1 such as UBE2N and UBCH5 isoforms (17, 18, 20) (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shownthatUBE2E1isautoubiquitinatedinvitrointheabsence or presence of an E3 ligase (30, 31), although the relevance of this activity in vivo was not clear. We show here that OTUB1 noncatalytically inhibits UBE2E1 autoubiquitination in vitro in either the presence or absence of E3 ligase (Fig. 4). Analysis of whole cell lysates showed that the dramatic reduction in UBE2E1proteinlevelsinOTUB1knockoutorknockdowncells could be rescued by expressing either WT OTUB1 or its cata- lyticallyinactivemutant,OTUB1C91S,butnottheOTUB1T134R mutant that is defective in binding to E2 enzymes (18, 28) (Fig. 2). When OTUB1 is depleted, autoubiquitination of UBE2E1 leads to rapid degradation by the proteasome and shortened half-life in the cell (Fig. 3). In pull-downs of ubiquitinated proteins from cells, we found that WT HA-UBE2E1 was ubiquitinated, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, HA-UBE2E1C131A (Fig. 5), consistent with autoubiquitination incells. Takentogether,theseresults supportaroleforOTUB1 inregulatingautoubiquitinationandproteolyticdegradationof UBE2E1.
UBE2E1/UBCH6 belongs to the UBE2E family of E2s, com- prised of UBE2E1, UBE2E2, and UBE2E3. Our proteomics data uncovered lower protein levels for UBE2E2 in addition to UBE2E1 (Fig. 1A), indicating that OTUB1 probably also regu- lates the stability of this E2. Because all members of the UBE2E family can autoubiquitinate themselves in vitro (30, 31), the mechanism of stabilization we observed for OTUB1-UBE2E1 likely extends to UBE2E2 and UBE2E3. All three UBE2E family members can interact with a broad set of E3 ubiquitin ligases (46), suggesting that OTUB1 may have further downstream effects on other substrates that are ubiquitinated by UBE2E enzymes.
We have also demonstrated that neither OTUB1 nor UBE2E1 has a detectable effect on ubiquitination of histone H2A, contrary to a recent report (34). Despite assays of multi- ple biological replicates in OTUB1 siRNA knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout U2OS cells, we detected no difference in histone ubiquitination using highly selective antibodies against H2A Lys-119Ub. We speculate that differences in methods for extracting histones may give rise to these discrep- ancies. In this study, we analyzed histones that were acid extracted and fully solubilized from chromatin fractions, and normalized loading relative to histone H3. Based on our obser-
OTUB1non-catalyticallyregulatesthestabilityofUBE2E1
vations, we hypothesize that UBE2E1 is likely not the primary cognate E2-conjugating enzyme for the PRC1 E3 ligase. The UBCH5 isoforms ubiquitinate histone H2A in concert with PRC1 in vitro (44, 45), and TRIM37, an E3 ligase that associates withPRC2,ubiquitinatesH2Ainhumanbreastcancercelllines where RING1B of PRC1 is down-regulated (47). Further exper- iments targeting both UBE2E1 and the UBCH5 isoforms may shedlightonwhichE2isprimarilyresponsibleforH2ALys-119 ubiquitination in cells.
The results of our OTUB1 knockout in mice indicate that OTUB1 plays a critical role in embryonic development. How- ever, the molecular basis for this late embryonic lethal pheno- typeiscurrentlyunclear.Basedonourcellcultureexperiments, itistemptingtospeculatethatOTUB1depletioncausesembry- onic lethality by destabilizing UBE2E1 and impairing ubiquiti- nationofitstargets,oneofwhichmightplayanessentialrolein embryogenesis. However, Ube2e1 knockout mice are viable (IMPC database), making it unlikely that the mechanism we describehere is the only contributing factor to the embryonic lethal phenotype. It is possible that a combination of the catalytic activity of OTUB1 and its ability to inhibit E2-con- jugating enzymes contribute to its importance in develop- ment. Further studies will be needed to determine defini- tively the developmental pathways that are disrupted in the absence of OTUB1.
In summary, we have shown that OTUB1 noncatalytically regulates the stability and protein levels of UBE2E1 in the cell. Evidence suggests that ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, ubiqui- tin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes exist in complex in vivo (27, 48). Our results demonstrate that these complexes maynotonlyservetoregulateubiquitinatedsubstrates,butalso affect the levels of ubiquitin machinery in the cell. OTUB1 was previously known to noncatalytically prevent ubiquitination of substratesbybindingtoE2-conjugatingenzymes.Herewehave shown a new role for OTUB1 noncatalytic inhibition, namely by preventing E2 autoubiquitination that leads to proteasomal degradation. Our findings add a new layer of complexity to the increasingly complex mechanism of OTUB1-regulated ubiqui- tin signaling in the cell.

Cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mM PMSF. Whole cell lysate was made by adding 100 (cid:5)l of RIPA buffer containing 1(cid:7) protease inhibitor (Roche) and 10 mM NEM to one-third of the cell pel- let. Lysate was clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, at 4 °C and boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Lysate was analyzed for efficient knockdown of the protein of interest. The remaining two-thirds cell pellet was used for acid extrac- tion of histones (50). Cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM PMSF, 10 mM NEM, and 1(cid:7) Protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 30 min on rotatorat4 °C.Afterhypotoniclysis,intactnucleiwerepelleted by centrifuging in a cooled table top microcentrifuge at 10,000 (cid:7) g for 10 min.

nal Pico ECL (Thermo Scientific) was used for chemilumines- cent detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Chemiluminescent signals were detected with the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Touch imaging system.
Cyclohexamidechaseassay
Cycloheximide was added to the cell culture at a final con- centration of 50 (cid:5)g/ml after 48 h of transfection with either siRNA or plasmid. Cells were harvested at various time points and whole cell lysate was prepared in RIPA lysis buffer supple- mented with protease inhibitor. Lysates were subject to West- ern hybridization to analyze the protein stability. The intensity of the protein bands was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).
Extractionofubiquitin-chargedE2sfromcells
Whole cell lysate was prepared in low-pH, nonreducing lysis buffer (50 mM MES, pH 4.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor) and immediately loaded onto SDS- PAGE gel with and without adding (cid:4)-mercaptoethanol. Ubiq- uitin-charged E2 levels were analyzed by Western blotting.
Proteinexpressionandpurification
UBE2E1 was cloned into the pETSUMO vector containing an N-terminal His tag followed by a SENP2 protease cleavage site. The catalytic mutant of OTUB1 and the N-terminal dele- tion (22 amino acids) of RNF4 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Strat- agene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cloning of human OTUB1 was performed as described previously (9).
All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 DE3 cells and grown in M9ZB media. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.5. Addition of 1 mM isopropyl (cid:4)-D-1-thiogalac- topyranoside initiated protein expression and the cells were incubated overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by pelleting at 4000 rpm at 4 °C. Purification of the catalytic mutant OTUB1C91S (9), RNF4 (51), human E1 enzyme (52), and ubiq- uitin (41) were performed as previously described. Cell pellets containing His-UBE2E1 were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 2 mM (cid:4)-mercaptoethanol). 0.1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to cells before lysing with a microfluidizer (Micro- fluidics). After lysis, cellular debris was pelleted by centrifuga- tion and the lysate was then run over a 5-ml HisTrap (GE Bio- sciences)foraffinitypurification.His-UBE2E1waselutedusing a linear gradient of 250 mM imidazole over 10 column volumes. The His tag was removed by incubation with 10 mM SENP2 overnight at 4 °C during dialysis into lysis buffer. Another round of HisTrap purification was used to remove cleaved pro- tein from SENP2. After the His tag subtraction, flow-through fractions of UBE2E1 were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, and 7.5 mM (cid:4)-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. UBE2E1 was further purified usingcationexchangechromatography,elutingoffalineargra- dient at 100 mM NaCl. Clean fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 25 mM Tris buffer, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, and 7.5 mM (cid:4)-mercaptoethanol, concentrated, and stored at (cid:4)80 °C.
