Abstract
Phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine 3 (H3T3) by Haspin recruits the chromosomal
passenger complex to the inner centromere and ensures proper cell cycle progression
through mitosis. The mechanism by which Haspin binds to nucleosomes to
phosphorylate H3T3 is not known. We report here cryo-EM structures of the Haspin
kinase domain bound to a nucleosome. In contrast with previous structures of histone-
modifying enzymes, Haspin solely contacts the nucleosomal DNA, inserting into a
supergroove formed by apposing major grooves of two DNA gyres. This unique binding
mode provides a plausible mechanism by which Haspin can bind to nucleosomes in a
condensed chromatin environment to phosphorylate H3T3. We identify key basic
residues in the Haspin kinase domain that are essential for phosphorylation of
nucleosomal histone H3 and binding to mitotic chromatin. Our structure is the first of a
kinase domain bound to a nucleosome and is the first example of a histone-modifying
enzyme that binds to nucleosomes solely through DNA contacts.

Introduction
Post-translational modification of histones regulates fundamental biological processes,
including transcription, DNA replication, the DNA damage response, and the cell cycle 1.
Histone phosphorylation regulates the cell cycle by triggering a cascade of histone
modifications to promote chromatin condensation during mitosis 2,3. Phosphorylation of
histone H3 threonine 3 (H3T3ph) and histone H2A threonine 120 (H2AT120ph) define
the inner centromere and are two of the most prominent mitotic phosphoryl
modifications 4. H3T3ph, which is established at the nuclear envelope in early prophase,
becomes most concentrated at inner centromeres during metaphase, and gradually
diminishes during anaphase 5. The Repo-Man/PP1γ complex dephosphorylates
H3T3ph to oppose the spread of this modification to chromosome arms in early mitosis
and catalyzes the removal of H3T3ph at the end of mitosis 6. H3T3ph recruits the
chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) to inner centromeres 4,7,8. The CPC, one of the
main controllers of mitosis 9, contains the highly conserved Aurora B kinase, which
phosphorylates multiple histone H3 residues 10 and many kinetochore proteins 11 at the
centromere.
The Haspin kinase establishes and maintains wild-type levels of H3T3ph during mitosis
12,13 and is conserved in most eukaryotes, including yeast, plants, flies, and worms 14,15.
The only known substrate of Haspin is histone H3T3. Depletion or inhibition of Haspin
abolishes H3T3ph 13, displaces the CPC from centromeres 16, causes premature
chromatid separation 17, prevents normal chromosome alignment 13, and delays mitotic

progression 16,18. The BUB1 kinase can partially compensate for loss of Haspin by
phosphorylating histone H2A-T120, which helps recruit the CPC to inner centromeres 19
20,21. Although earlier studies have argued that the H3T3 kinase, VRK1, is also
important for generating H3T3ph during mitosis 22,23, more recent work suggests that
VRK1 is not essential for generating mitotic H3T3ph, while Haspin is essential 24.
Human Haspin is a 798 amino acid protein that contains a ~450 residue disordered N-
terminal region and a C-terminal atypical kinase domain 25-28. Haspin’s structured C-
terminal kinase domain has a bilobal shape similar to that of proteins belonging to the
eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) family 14,27,28, one of the largest families of eukaryotic
proteins 29. Haspin contains a negatively charged active-site cleft between its two
structured lobes where the histone H3 tail and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the
phosphate donor, bind 28,30. Mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4
(H3K4me1/2/3), which is commonly found at actively transcribed genes 31, inhibit
Haspin activity 28, likely though steric clash of the methylated lysine within the enzyme’s
acidic active site cleft 30. Since Haspin is important for ensuring proper mitotic
progression 12,13 and is overexpressed in many cancers 32, there have been extensive
efforts to identify and characterize compounds that inhibit Haspin H3T3 phosphorylation
activity 28,33-36.
Whereas the structural basis by which Haspin recognizes the histone H3 tail is well-
characterized 27,28,30, nothing is known about how this enzyme engages an intact

nucleosome substrate. While many chromatin-binding proteins contact the nucleosome
acidic patch and other residues in the histone octamer core 37-39, these surfaces are
often occluded in a condensed chromatin environment. It is not known how Haspin
binds to nucleosomes in these conditions.
We report here the structure of the Haspin kinase domain bound to a nucleosome
determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Unlike all previous structural
studies of nucleosome binding proteins, Haspin does not contact the globular histone
core. Instead, Haspin exclusively contacts the DNA, inserting into a cavity formed by
apposed major grooves of two adjacent gyres of nucleosomal DNA. Haspin engages
the unique geometry of this DNA “supergroove” 40 with basic residues that contact the
negatively charged DNA sugar-phosphate backbone. The positioning of Haspin in the
supergroove between superhelical locations (SHL) 5.5 and -2.5 enables Haspin to bind
the histone H3 tail and engage its H3T3 substrate. Our structure, the first of any histone
kinase domain bound to chromatin, reveals a novel mode of nucleosome binding that
can allow Haspin to phosphorylate its histone substrate in both open and condensed
chromatin.

To investigate the structural basis by which Haspin binds nucleosomes, we used cryo-
EM to determine structures of the Haspin kinase domain (residues 465-798) bound to
nucleosome core particles wrapped with 185 bp of DNA containing the 147 bp Widom
601 sequence flanked by 19 bp linkers (185bp) (Table 1, Figure S1). Samples were
prepared by mixing Haspin with nucleosome in the absence of crosslinker and flash-
freezing on cryo-EM grids (see Methods). The cryo-EM density maps revealed Haspin
bound to the side of the nucleosome disk, engaging both gyres of nucleosomal DNA
(Figure 1A-B). We identified two similar but distinct orientations of Haspin, denoted
positions 1 and 2 (Figure 1C). The global resolution estimates for the EM maps of
Haspin in positions 1 and 2 were 3.01 Å and 2.99 Å, respectively (Figures S2A-B). The
local resolution of Haspin in position 1 is ~4 Å and ~5 Å in position 2 (Figures S2C-D).
Within the EM density for each Haspin kinase domain, the resolution is highest at the
interface between Haspin and the nucleosome. The fit for the Haspin model in position
1 was slightly better than for Haspin in position 2, but the secondary structure of both
Haspin molecules fits well within their respective EM maps (Figures S2E-F). The
structure of the Haspin kinase domain is very similar to previously published crystal
structures (Figure S3) 27,28,30, indicating that there are no significant conformational
changes in Haspin upon binding to nucleosome.

the Haspin kinase domain does not contact the histone core. Instead, the enzyme binds
to nucleosomal DNA by inserting into a large cavity formed by the apposition of major
grooves on the two neighboring gyres of nucleosomal DNA, termed a “supergroove” 40
(Figure 2A). There are multiple such supergrooves at different locations around the
nucleosome core particle. The specific supergroove to which Haspin binds is composed
of the major grooves at superhelical locations (SHL) 5.5 and -2.5. (Figure 2A). To our
knowledge, this is the first example of any protein that binds to a nucleosome in this
manner.
Extensive electrostatic interactions between the positively charged surface of the
Haspin kinase domain and the negatively charged DNA stabilize Haspin binding to the
nucleosome (Figure 2B). The positive ends of the Haspin αE and αH helix dipoles
insert into the DNA supergroove (Figure 2C), while residues K759 and K761 in the loop
connecting helices αF and αH form electrostatic interactions with the sugar-phosphate
backbone on either side of the major groove at SHL 5.5 (Figure 2C-E). In addition,
K659 forms electrostatic interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone adjacent to
SHL 5.5 (Figure 2C,F), and R772 interacts with the DNA phosphate backbone adjacent
to SHL -2.5 (Figure 2C,G). Side chain and main chain atoms of K759 and T760 are
sufficiently close to DNA bases at positions 55 and -56 to form van der Waals
interactions. We note that the DNA sequence in this location is not identical in the
twofold symmetry-related nucleosomal DNA, but the density is ambiguous, suggesting
that our maps likely represent an average of particles containing Haspin bound to one

or the other symmetry-related supergrooves. There are otherwise no apparent contacts
with the DNA bases.
The identification of two distinct Haspin positions on the nucleosome suggests that
there is some flexibility in the positioning of Haspin within the supergroove.
Superposition of the nucleosomes in the two models corresponding to Haspin positions
1 and 2 shows the kinase domain rotates by ~8.3° about a pivot point located in the
DNA major groove at SHL 5.5 (Figure 1C). The direction of the rotational change in
Haspin position follows the curve of the major groove at SHL 5.5. Although Haspin
contacts both DNA gyres, the rotational change in enzyme position about a pivot point
at SHL 5.5 suggests that interactions with the SHL 5.5 DNA gyre play a more dominant
role in positioning Haspin than interactions with the SHL -2.5 DNA gyre.
The end of the H3 tail in the Haspin active site was poorly resolved, likely due to
heterogeneity in the position of Haspin bound to nucleosome (Figure 1C). To better
resolve the H3 tail, we removed the EM density corresponding to nucleosome from the
cryo-EM particle stack using signal subtraction and performed local refinement and
alignment of the Haspin kinase domain alone (Table 1, Figure S1) to a final resolution
of 3.64 Å (Figure S4A). The local resolution of the Haspin local refinement ranged from
~2 Å at the center of the EM map to ~10 Å at the periphery (Figures S4B), allowing a
better Haspin model fit at the center of EM map than at the periphery (Figure S4C). We
observed well-resolved EM density for H3 residues 2-5 showing a 180° turn of the H3

tail, positioning H3R2, H3T3, and H3K4 deep within the Haspin acidic cleft (Figure 3A-
B).This is consistent with a previously determined crystal structure of Haspin bound to
H3 tail peptide (1-7) showing a similar binding position and turn in the H3 tail (PDB:
4OUC) 30 (Figure S5A-B).
Although no ATP or nucleotide analogs were added during sample preparation, we also
observed density for a small molecule in the Haspin ATP binding site (Figure 3C-D).
We presume that the density corresponds to a small molecule that bound to Haspin
during its overexpression and remained bound during purification. Superposition of the
crystal structure of Haspin kinase domain bound to adenosine monophosphate (AMP)
(PDB: 3DLZ) 28 shows a good fit of an AMP molecule to the EM density (Figure 3C-D).
While we did not observe strong EM density for the histone H3 tail in our initial
unsharpened cryo-EM maps (Figure 1A-B), low-pass filtering the map of Haspin bound
to nucleosome in position 1 revealed low-resolution density for the H3 tail (Figure 4A).
The H3 tail follows a path along the nucleosomal DNA, bridging the gap to Haspin’s
structured N-terminal kinase domain lobe, and inserting into the Haspin active site
(Figure 4B). While individual residues cannot be resolved in this map, this portion of the
H3 tail contains multiple positively charged residues that could form favorable
electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA backbone (Figure 4C).
Whereas our model shows one discrete representative model for the path of the H3 tail
along the nucleosome, the low resolution of the EM density for the tail suggests that

these residues are highly mobile and can adopt multiple conformations along its path to
the Haspin active site.
Binding to the SHL 5.5/-2.5 DNA supergroove would place the Haspin active site ~69 Å
from H3K37, the last well-ordered histone H3 residue, which emerges between the DNA
gyres (Figure 4D). Since the maximum distance that can be covered by H3 residues 3-
37 is ~119 Å, binding to the SHL 5.5/-2.5 DNA supergroove positions Haspin at an
optimal distance to bind the extended histone H3 tail with Thr3 in the enzyme active
site. Binding to the adjacent major supergroove at SHL 4.5/-3.5 would place the Haspin
active site ~127 Å from H3K37, (Figure 4E), which would position Haspin too far away
to bind to H3T3. Although binding to the supergroove at SHL 6.5/-1.5 would place the
Haspin active site only ~36 Å from H3K37, well within reach of H3T3 (Figure 4E), we
did not observe EM density for Haspin in this supergroove. We note that the H3 tail
would need to form a long loop or fold upon itself to place H3T3 within the enzyme
active site at the SHL 6.5/-1.5 supergroove. A less extended conformation of the H3 tail
would likely reduce the potential to form ionic interactions with the DNA, making this a
less-favored binding site for Haspin.
Since the 2.5/-5.5 supergroove is symmetrically analogous to the 5.5/-2.5 supergroove,
Haspin should be able to bind to both supergrooves, which would result in particles
corresponding to 2:1 Haspin:nucleosome complexes. However, our analysis of the cryo-
EM data revealed particles with just one Haspin kinase domain bound to a nucleosome,

or no bound enzyme at all. We speculate that the affinity of Haspin for nucleosomes is
not high enough to have produced a significant number of 2:1 Haspin:nucleosome
complexes at the Haspin and nucleosome concentrations used for cryo-EM sample
preparation. Consistent with this explanation, 47% of nucleosomes in the cryo-EM data
were not bound by Haspin (Figure S1) and needed to be removed using 3D
classification to obtain a stack of particles containing only nucleosomes with bound
Haspin.
Basic residues are important for Haspin binding and activity in vitro and in cells
To evaluate the contributions of individual Haspin residues to nucleosome binding, we
assayed the effects of point substitutions on the affinity of Haspin for nucleosomes
using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Increasing concentrations of wild-
type Haspin resulted in the formation of a discrete shifted band, which presumably
corresponds to a 1:1 complex of Haspin bound to nucleosome (Figure 5A). At the
highest concentrations of Haspin, there appeared a high molecular weight smear
resulting from non-specific aggregates of Haspin and nucleosome. In binding assays of
Haspin point mutants containing the charge-reversal substitutions, K659E, K759E,
K761E, or R772E, the discrete band corresponding to a complex of Haspin bound to
nucleosome is lost (Figure 5A). Introducing all four substitutions in Haspin abrogated all
detectable binding to nucleosomes, even at an enzyme concentration of 32 μM (Figure
5A).

To confirm the relevance of the observed Haspin-DNA contacts to kinase activity, we
assayed the effects of Haspin mutations on phosphorylation of nucleosomal histone
H3T3. Point substitutions K659E, K759E, K761E, and R772E in Haspin all reduced the
rate of H3T3 phosphorylation as compared to wild-type enzyme (Figure 5B-C),
Incorporating all four charge-reversal substitutions into Haspin dramatically reduced
activity (Figure 5D). These substitutions had no effect on the ability of Haspin to
phosphorylate free histone H3 (Figure 5E) confirming that the mutations affect
nucleosome binding only, not enzymatic activity.
We next tested whether the residues identified as important for DNA binding in vitro are
also important for chromatin binding of full-length Haspin in cells. HEK293T cells were
transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Haspin to assess
its association with mitotic chromosomes. Consistent with previous reports, wild-type
EGFP-Haspin co-localized with DAPI-stained DNA in fixed cell imaging (Figure 6A).
Strikingly, each of the four charge-reversal mutations (K659E, K759E, K761E, and
R772E) caused a greater than four-fold reduction in the co-localization of Haspin with
chromatin as compared to wild-type Haspin and was comparable to the EGFP-only
control (Figure 6B). Interestingly, some cells transfected with the Haspin mutant formed
protein aggregates (Figure 6A), which were not observed in cells transfected with wild-
type Haspin. Taken together, these results support the importance of the DNA contacts
observed in the cryo-EM structure of the Haspin kinase domain bound to a nucleosome.

Discussion
Previous investigations had revealed the mechanism by which Haspin engages an H3
tail peptide 30, but it was not known how Haspin recognizes an intact nucleosome
substrate. Our structure unexpectedly shows that the Haspin kinase domain binds
solely to the nucleosomal DNA, inserting into the cavity called a supergroove 40 that is
formed by two adjacent DNA major grooves (Figures 1 and 2). To our knowledge, this
is the first report of a protein that binds to this unique feature of nucleosomes and the
first reported structure of a histone-modifying enzyme that does not contact the globular
histone octamer core.
The potential of DNA supergrooves for specific interactions with proteins was first
proposed by Edayathumangalam, Luger, and colleagues 40 in their study of a polyamide
that binds to two adjacent minor grooves in the nucleosome, it was noted that the
nucleosome contains multiple major and minor supergrooves, each arising from the
apposition of DNA major and minor grooves on adjacent DNA gyres. While these
supergrooves were proposed as potential sites that could be recognized by proteins that
form sequence-specific base pair contacts within the supergroove 40, Haspin primarily
contacts the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA and does not appear to recognize
specific bases. This lack of specific interactions is consistent with the biological role of
Haspin, which must bind to nucleosomes with diverse sequences.

The observed electrostatic interactions between the Haspin kinase domain and
nucleosomal DNA are essential for Haspin binding to nucleosomes in vitro (Figure 5)
and to chromatin in cells (Figure 6). Previous studies had shown that Haspin can bind
DNA 25 and speculated that the many positively charged residues in the unstructured N-
terminus of Haspin mediated DNA binding 14,25,26. However, we have shown that
charge-reversal substitutions of four key basic residues in the Haspin kinase domain
almost completely abolish Haspin localization to mitotic chromatin in HEK293T cells
(Figure 6). While we cannot rule out the possibility that basic residues in the disordered
N-terminal region of Haspin also contribute to chromatin binding, our results suggest
that the observed interactions of the Haspin kinase domain with nucleosomal DNA is
primarily responsible for the binding of this enzyme to chromatin.
Are there other proteins that bind to nucleosome supergrooves? A Foldseek41 search of
the Alphafold database for structures similar to the C-terminal kinase domain lobe of
Haspin (610-798) identified seven structurally related human proteins, all of which are
kinases: AKT1, CLK2, MAPK1, MAPK14, CLK4, MAPK3, and PINK1. Whereas
Haspin’s αH helix and αF-αH loop form extensive electrostatic interactions within the
nucleosomal DNA supergroove (Figure 2C), all seven related proteins have a shorter
αH helix and repositioned αF-αH loop that would not permit a mode of DNA binding
similar to Haspin (Figure 7A). In addition, none of the structural homologues has an
electropositive surface that would be required to bind to negatively charged DNA
(Figure 7B). The ability of Haspin to bind to a major DNA supergroove thus appears to

be an adaptation of the conserved kinase domain to bind nucleosomes. Future
structural and bioinformatics investigations should help determine whether there are
other chromatin-binding proteins that recognize the unique features of major and minor
DNA supergrooves.
Methods
Expression and purification of histones
Expression plasmids for Xenopus laevis histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 were a gift from
Greg Bowman (Johns Hopkins University). Histones were expressed and purified as
previously described 42, with the following modifications. Thawed cell pellet was lysed
with multiple passes through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics). After lysis, centrifugation,
and multiple washes using a Triton X-100 containing buffer, washed cell pellets were
resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 7 M Guanidine HCl, 10 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT). Resuspended washed cell pellets were size exclusion purified using
a buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 7 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol
(BME). Fractions were pooled and injected onto a 2-column series with a HiTrap Q-XL
column connected upstream of a HiTrap SP-XL column using a buffer containing 20 mM
Tris pH 7.8, 7 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM BME). The Q-XL column was removed from
the system, and then the histones were eluted from the SP-XL column with a gradient of
0 – 1 M NaCl on an ÄKTA Pure (Cytiva) chromatography system.

The Widom 601 DNA sequence (147 bp) 43 was expressed in I strain XL-1 Blue using
the pST55-16x601 plasmid 44. The 601 sequence was expressed, purified, and isolated
as described 45. The 601 sequence used is:

The Widom 601 DNA flanked by 19 bp of linker DNA at each end (185 bp) was
amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers (IDT DNA) containing
19 bp overhanging regions using the linear double-stranded 147 bp 601 DNA as a

phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution 25:24:1 was added to an equal volume of
resuspended PCR product pellet, vortexed, and centrifuged to separate the phases.
The organic phase was removed and the aqueous phase was extracted twice more the
same way. All of the removed organic phases were pooled, back-extracted with TE
buffer to collect any PCR product left behind in the organic phase, and all the aqueous
phases combined and saved as the purified PCR product. Purified PCR product, 3 M
sodium acetate pH 5.2, and 100% EtOH was combined in a 10 : 1 : 20 ratio and placed
at -20°C overnight. The precipitated purified PCR product was then centrifuged, the
pellet washed with 70% EtOH, centrifuged again, and allowed to dry. This pellet of
purified 185bp 601 DNA was then resuspended in MilliQ (Sigma) water and stored at -
20°C.
Preparation of nucleosomes
Unmodified nucleosome (185bp) was reconstituted as previously described 42, with the
following modifications.
For each nucleosome sample, histone octamer and Widom 601 DNA was combined in
an octamer:DNA molar ratio of 1.2 : 1 in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 M
KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, such that the final DNA concentration was 6 μM. The salt
concentration was gradually reduced to 0.25 M KCl over 24 hours by salt gradient
dialysis to assemble nucleosome. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the

purity of the nucleosome sample was assessed using an electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA). If the nucleosome sample showed excess free DNA or higher-order
species, it was further purified by loading onto a SK DEAE-5PW column (TOSOH
biosciences) using a buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.25 M KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT, and eluted with a gradient of 0.25 – 0.6 M KCl on an Agilent HPLC
instrument. Purified nucleosome was dialyzed into a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.
Purification of Haspin and Haspin mutants
Haspin plasmid construct (GSG2) was a gift from Nicola Burgess-Brown (Addgene
plasmid # 38915 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:38915 ; RRID:Addgene_38915). This construct
was used to create Haspin mutant constructs using around-the-horn mutagenesis. The
original Addgene wild-type Haspin construct or Haspin mutant constructs encoding
Haspin (465-798) fused to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (6xHis) and Tobacco Etch
Virus (TEV) protease cut site, were transformed into BL21(DE3)Rosetta2-pLysS E. coli
cells. The colonies were used to inoculate 5 mL volumes of media, which were
expanded to larger 1 L volumes of media for the full-scale growth. Cultures were grown
at 37°C and 200 RPM in 2x Yeast Extract Tryptone (2XYT) media supplemented with
kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Cultures were induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-
ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the culture reached an OD600 of 0.4 and were
grown for an additional 16 hours at 18°C.The cells were harvested by centrifugation and

#11836153001), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.
The frozen cell pellet suspensions were thawed in a water bath and an equal volume of
buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT,
and 0.2 mM PMSF was added. The diluted cell suspensions were lysed by sonication
for three rounds each of 1 min total processing time (5 sec on/ 10 sec off) at 40%
power. The resulting whole cell extracts were centrifuged at 17,000 RPM and the
supernatants were filtered using a 1.1 μm filter to obtain clarified extracts. Clarified
extracts were loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap HP (Cytiva) column equilibrated in 20 mM

Cryo-EM sample preparation
Wild-type Haspin (465-798) containing an N-terminal 6xHis tag and TEV protease cut-
site was thawed on ice and mixed with nucleosome containing 147 bp 601 Widom DNA
with 19 bp linkers (185 bp) to a final concentration of 8 μM Haspin and 4 μM
nucleosome in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, The
mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 gold 300 mesh grids
(Electron Microscopy Sciences #Q350AR1.3) were glow-discharged for 45 seconds at
15mA using a PELCO easiGLOW Glow Discharge System to apply a negative charge
to their surface. Then, 3 μL of sample mixture was applied to the grid, immediately
blotted for 4.5 seconds with a blot force of 3, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a
Vitrobot Mark IV apparatus (Thermo Fisher) set to 100% humidity and 4°C.
Cryo-EM data collection
To evaluate the feasibility of determining the cryo-EM structure of Haspin bound to
nucleosome without using crosslinker, a small cryo-EM dataset of Haspin bound to
nucleosome was collected at the Beckman Center for Cryo-EM at the Johns Hopkins

refinement to produce Haspin bound to nucleosome in position 1 (152,199 particles,
3.01 Å), and Hapsin bound to nucleosome in position 2 (154,151 particles, 2.99 Å).
Cryo-EM model building and refinement
Initial models of Haspin bound to nucleosome were constructed by using rigid body
fitting of models for an unmodified nucleosome (PDB: 4ZUX)48, and Haspin (PDB:
4OUC) 30 into EM density maps using in ChimeraX 49, and then refined using all-atom
flexible refinement with strong restraints in Coot 0.9.6 50. All waters, ions, and small
molecules were stripped from the original structures so that only the atoms
corresponding to nucleosome and Haspin could be used for model building. Histone
tails were extended where density was visible, and the nucleosomal DNA was extended
from 147 bp to 157 bp to account for the extra-nucleosomal linker DNA present in this
sample. The modeled Haspin includes residues 470-798. The models were further
refined in PHENIX 51 using phenix.real_space_refine 52 and validated using the cryo-EM
Comprehensive Validation module in PHENIX running MolProbity 53. Figures were
generated with ChimeraX 49.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
Binding reactions were prepared in 12 μL volumes by combining Haspin and
nucleosome in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM
DTT). Nucleosome was always added last. Prepared reactions were incubated on ice
for 30 min to allow them to come to equilibrium. Prior to sample loading, 6% TBE gels

(TBE) buffer. Then, 10 μL of each equilibrated binding reaction was loaded on the
prepared gel and run at 150 V for 90 min at 4°C in 0.25X TBE buffer. Gels were stained
in the dark on a rotating shaker for 20 min with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) DNA-
intercalating stain diluted to 1:5000, then imaged.
Immunoblotting activity assays
Assays to test wild-type Haspin (465-798) and Haspin mutants (465-798) histone H3
threonine 3 (H3T3) phosphorylation activity were prepared in 20 μL volumes by
combining Haspin and nucleosome in kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM
KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM ATP, and 0.25 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
(BSA) (GoldBio #A-420-250)). Nucleosomes was added last to initiate the reactions,
which were incubated at room temp. Time points at 5, 15, and 45 minutes were
collected by quenching 6 μL of each reaction in 1.5X lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS)
sample buffer. Prior to sample loading, Quenched reactions were separated on a 4-12%
Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher) by SDS-PAGE then transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad).
Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in 1X Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20
(TBST) buffer, probed with 1:5000 anti-H3T3ph (Sigma-Aldrich #04-746) or 1:5000 anti-
