Abstract Monoubiquitination of histones H2B-K120 (H2BK120ub) and H2A-K119 (H2AK119ub) play opposing roles in regulating transcription and chromatin compaction. H2BK120ub is a hallmark of actively transcribed euchromatin, while H2AK119ub is highly enriched in transcriptionally repressed het- eroc hromatin. Whereas H2BK1 20ub is kno wn to stimulate the binding or activity of v arious chromatin-modifying enzymes, this post-translational modification (PTM) also interferes with the binding of se v eral proteins to the nucleosome H2A / H2B acidic patch via an unknown mechanism. Here, w e report cry oEM str uct ures of an H2BK120ub nucleosome showing that ubiquitin adopts discrete positions that occlude the acidic patch. Molecular dynamics simulations show that ubiquitin remains stably positioned over this nucleosome region. By contrast, our cryoEM str uct ures of H2AK119ub nucleosomes show ubiquitin adopting discrete positions that minimally occlude the acidic patch. Consistent with these observations, H2BK120ub, but not H2AK119ub, abrogates nucleosome interactions with acidic patch-binding proteins RCC1 and LANA, and single-domain antibodies specific to this region. Our results suggest a mechanism by which H2BK120ub serves as a gatekeeper to the acidic patch and point to distinct roles for histone H2AK119 and H2BK120 ubiquitination in regulating protein binding to nucleosomes.

Introduction
The nucleosome is the fundamental organizational unit of chromatin and comprises two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 wrapped by ∼147 base pairs (bp) of DNA. Nuclear proteins interact with the nucleosome at various sites including the histone core, histone tails, nucleosomal DNA, and extra-nucleosomal linker DNA ( 1 ,2 ). The core histones are subject to a wide array of post-translational modifica- tions (PTMs) that play a central role in regulating transcrip- tion ( 3 ), DNA replication ( 4 ), chromatin compaction ( 5 ), and the DNA damage response ( 6 ). PTMs ranging from small
chemical groups, such as methyl, acetyl, and phosphoryl, to the attachment of 76-amino acid ubiquitin ( 7 ), modulate pro- tein binding to chromatin and impact higher-order chromatin structure ( 8 ,9 ), thereby regulating downstream biological pro- cesses ( 10 ,11 ).
The nucleosome contains a conserved cluster of negatively charged residues in histones H2A and H2B, known as the nucleosome acidic patch ( 12 ), that is a hotspot for interac- tions with proteins that regulate transcription, the cell cy- cle, and the DNA damage response (reviewed in ( 2 )). Struc- tural studies have shown that proteins primarily engage the

nucleosome acidic patch with arginine residues ( 2 ), as first seen in the crystal structures of the viral peptide, LANA, bound to nucleosome ( 13 ) and the Ran guanine nucleotide ex- change factor (Ran GEF), RCC1, bound to a nucleosome ( 14 ). A recent proteomics study identified many additional proteins that bind the acidic patch and are involved in epigenetic reg- ulation, transcription, and cell-cycle regulation ( 15 ).
Monoubiquitination of histones H2B-K120 (H2BK120ub) and H2A-K119 (H2AK119ub) play opposing roles in tran- scription regulation and chromatin compaction ( 16 ,17 ). H2BK120ub is enriched in actively transcribed genes ( 18 ,19 ), where it stimulates methylation of histone H3-K4 ( 18 , 20 , 21 ) and H3-K79 ( 19 , 22 , 23 ). H2BK120ub is dynamically regu- lated throughout the cell cycle ( 24 ), serving as a signal for the DNA damage response ( 25 ) and chromatin decompaction ( 8 ). H2AK119ub is enriched at heterochromatic regions ( 26 ), where it stimulates trimethylation of H3K27 ( 27–29 ), a re- pressive mark ( 30 ), and promotes chromatin compaction ( 31 ,32 ).
There have been several reports that H2BK120ub can in- terfere with the binding of proteins to nucleosomes, includ- ing human RCC1, yeast Sir3, and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) pep- tide ( 33–35 ). All three proteins contact the nucleosome acidic patch, which raises the possibility that the ubiquitin conju- gated to H2BK120 interferes with their binding to this sur- face ( 13 , 14 , 36 ). However, a role for H2BK120ub in block- ing protein binding seems at odds with the presumed mobility of ubiquitin, given the flexibility of its carboxy-terminal tail and of the aliphatic lysine side-chain to which it is covalently linked ( 37 ). Such flexibility could, in principle, allow ubiquitin to adopt positions on the nucleosome surface that would not clash with protein binding.
To gain insight to the structural basis by which H2BK120ub could interfere with protein binding to the nucleosome, we de- termined cryoEM structures of nucleosomes containing ubiq- uitin conjugated to H2B-K120. We found that the ubiquitin adopts several distinct positions that partially occlude the nu- cleosome acidic patch. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that the ubiquitin conjugated to H2B-K120 remains stably associated over the nucleosome acidic patch, in posi- tions that would be expected to interfere with protein bind- ing. We also determined cryoEM structures of H2AK119ub nucleosomes and found that, while the ubiquitin adopts two distinct positions, neither significantly occludes the acidic patch. In vitro studies showed that H2BK120ub, but not H2AK119ub, dramatically reduces nucleosome binding by RCC1, LANA peptide, and single domain antibodies that specifically contact the acidic patch. Our results establish a mechanism by which H2BK120ub can regulate protein bind- ing to the nucleosome acidic patch, thereby impacting a major hub of chromatin interactions.
Materials and methods Expression and purification of ubiquitin Ubiquitin (G76C) was expressed and purified as previously described ( 38 ).
Expression and purification of histones Expression plasmids for Xenopus laevis histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were a gift from Gregory Bowman (Johns Hop-
9979
kins University). Histones were expressed and purified as previously described ( 39 ), with the following modifications. Thawed cell pellet was lysed with multiple passes through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics). After lysis, centrifugation, and multiple washes using a Triton X-100 containing buffer, washed cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 7 M Guanidine HCl, 10 mM dithiothre- itol (DTT). Resuspended washed cell pellets were size exclu- sion purified using a buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 7 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β -mercaptoethanol (BME). Frac- tions were pooled and injected onto a 2-column series with a HiTrap Q-XL column connected upstream of a HiTrap SP- XL column using a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 7 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM BME). The Q-XL column was removed from the system, and then the histones were eluted from the SP-XL column with a gradient of 0–1 M NaCl on an ÄKTA Pure (Cytiva) chromatography system.

Preparation and purification of dimethylated histone H3-K79 (H3K79me2) A methyl-lysine analog of H3K79me2 (H3K C 79me2) was pre- pared by alkylating the cysteine in histone H3K79C as previ- ously described ( 40 ) and lyophilized. To purify the reaction product, the lyophilized sample was dissolved in filtered 7 M guanidine HCl and loaded onto a PRO T O 300 C4 reverse- phase column (Higgins Analytical) with a buffer containing 0.1% TFA and eluted with a gradient of 0–90% acetoni- trile on an HPLC (Waters). The peaks corresponding to un- reacted histone H3-K79C and H3K C 79me2 were collected and identified. Identity and purity were determined by di- gesting a sample with trypsin and analyzing its mass / charge ratio using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization– Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). The H3K C 79me2 sample was dialyzed into 5 mM BME, ◦C. lyophilized, and stored at –20
Purification of Widom 601 DNA The Widom 601 DNA sequence (147 bp) ( 41 ) was expressed in Esc heric hia coli XL-1 Blue using the pST55-16 × 601 plas- mid ( 14 ). The 601 sequence was expressed, purified, and iso- lated as described ( 42 ). The 601 sequence used is:

C for 1 h. Pre- 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 (10:1:20) at –80 cipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation and the su- pernatant was removed. The pellet was washed with 70% EtOH and air dried before resuspending in TE Buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). The PCR product was pu- rified with PCI (phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1). PCI was added to an equal volume of resuspended PCR prod- uct pellet, vortexed, and centrifuged to separate the phases. The organic phase was removed and the aqueous phase was extracted twice more the same way. All of the removed or- ganic phases were pooled, back-extracted with TE buffer to collect any PCR product left behind in the organic phase, and all the aqueous phases were combined and saved as the pu- rified PCR product. Purified PCR product, 3 M sodium ac- etate pH 5.2, and 100% EtOH was combined in a 10:1:20 ◦C overnight. The precipitated puri- ratio and placed at –20 fied PCR product was then centrifuged, the pellet washed with 70% EtOH, centrifuged again, and allowed to dry. This pellet of purified 185bp 601 DNA was then resuspended in MilliQ (Sigma) water and stored at –20

Preparation of nucleosomes Nucleosomes for structural studies (unmod-Nuc 147 / 185 bp, H2AK119ub Nuc 147 / 185 bp, H2BK120ub Nuc 147 / 185 bp, H2BK120ub + H3K C 79me2 Nuc 185 bp) were reconstituted as previously described ( 39 ), with the modifications described below.
For each sample, histone octamer and Widom 601 DNA was combined in an octamer:DNA molar ratio of 1.2:1 in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 M KCl, 1 mM ED TA, 1 mM D TT, such that final DNA concentration was 6 μM. Nucleosomes were then assembled by salt gradient dialysis, reducing the salt concentration to 0.25 M KCl over 24 h. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation and nucle- osome purity assessed by native gel electrophoresis. Nucleo- some samples that showed excess free DNA or higher-order species were further purified by loading onto a SK DEAE-5PW column (TOSOH biosciences) equilibrated in buffer contain- ing 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.25 M KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and eluted with a gradient of 0.25–0.6 M KCl on an Agi- lent HPLC instrument. Purified nucleosome was dialyzed into a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80

Cultures were induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl- ß- d -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when they reached an OD 600 of 0.4–0.6, and were grown for an additional 18 h at ◦C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended 18 in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 tablet / 50 ml Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Millipore Sigma #11836153001), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80

The frozen cell pellet suspension was thawed in a wa- ter bath and an equal volume of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM PMSF added. Diluted cell suspension was lysed by sonication for three rounds each of 1 min total processing time (5 s on / 10 s off) at 40% power. The resulting whole cell extract was centrifuged at 17000 RPM and the supernatant fil- tered using a 1.1 μm filter. The resulting clarified extract was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap HP (Cytiva) column equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT and eluted with a gradient of 0.05–1 M imidazole on an ÄKTA Pure instrument (Cytiva). Eluted protein was di- luted with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF to a final salt concentration of 50 mM NaCl and filtered using a 1.1 μm filter. The resulting protein was loaded onto 5 mL HiTrap SP-HP (Cytiva) cation exchange column equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF and eluted with a gradient of 0.05–2 M NaCl. Eluted protein was dialyzed overnight in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM PMSF, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80

CryoEM data processing Data on H2BK120ub nucleosomes were processed in cryoSPARC v4.1 ( 47 ). Exposures were motion-corrected and cropped to one-half of their original resolution using Patch Motion Correction. The contrast transfer function (CTF) cor- rection was performed using Patch Motion Correction. Poor quality micrographs were removed using Manually Curate Exposures, yielding 8149 high-quality micrographs. An ini- tial round of particle picking was performed using Blob Picker and Inspect Picks, then extracted using Extract from Micro- graphs. A set of 2D templates was created by first perform- ing 2D classification on the extracted particles, then select- ing representative views using Select 2D classes. These tem- plates were used to perform a second round of particle pick-
ing using Template Picker and Inspect Picks, then extracted using Extract from Micrographs to yield an uncleaned par- ticle stack of 754004 particles. One round of 2D Classifica- tion and Select 2D Classes was performed to remove junk particles by discarding distinctly poor quality 2D classes to yield a partially cleaned particle stack of 550718 particles. Additional particle cleaning was performed using four par- allel 4-structure Ab-Initio Reconstruction jobs, keeping par- ticles from the good classes, which yielded a cleaned particle stack of 329531 particles. These particles were aligned along their C2 symmetry axis using the Non-Uniform Refinement job ( 48 ) and then symmetry-expanded to double the effec- tive number of particles to 659062 particles. One round of focused 3D Classification was performed with a spherical fo- cus mask centered on the area of blurred ubiquitin density to yield four distinct ubiquitin positions. Individual particle CTF was refined with Local CTF Refinement, image group CTF was refined with Global CTF Refinement, and structures were refined with local refinement to produce H2BK120 ubiq- uitin position 1 (76770 particles, 3.32 Å resolution), position 2 (71307 particles, 3.33 Å resolution), position 3 (73431 par- ticles, 3.34 Å resolution), and position 4 (65167 particles, 3.36 Å resolution). The final maps were sharpened with Local Fil- tering.
Data on H2BK120ub + H3K C 79me2 nucleosomes were processed in cryoSPARC v3.3 ( 47 ). Exposures were motion- corrected and cropped to one-half of their original resolu- tion using Patch Motion Correction. The CTF correction was performed using Patch CTF Estimation. Poor quality mi- crographs were removed using Manually Curate Exposures, yielding 7324 high-quality micrographs. An initial round of particle picking was performed using Blob Picker and Inspect Picks, then extracted using Extract from Micrographs. A set of 2D templates was created by first performing 2D Classi- fication on the extracted particles then selecting representa- tive views using Select 2D classes. These templates were used to perform a second round of particle picking using Tem- plate Picker and Inspect Picks, then extracted using Extract from Micrographs to yield an uncleaned particle stack of 2288109 particles. Two rounds of 2D Classification and Select 2D Classes was performed to remove junk particles by dis- carding distinctly poor quality 2D classes, yielding a partially cleaned particle stack of 1034537 particles. Additional parti- cle cleaning was performed using multiple iterations of Ab- Initio Reconstruction jobs, yielding a cleaned particle stack of 628403 particles. The particles were aligned along their C2 symmetry axis using the Non-Uniform Refinement job ( 48 ) and then symmetry-expanded to double the effective num- ber of particles to 1256806 particles. Three rounds of focused 3D Classification were performed with a large spherical focus mask centered on H2BK120 on one face of the nucleosome to yield two distinct ubiquitin positions. Individual particle CTF was refined with Local CTF refinement, and structures were refined with Local Refinement to yield maps showing H2BK120 ubiquitin positions 5 (818874 particles, 2.93 Å res- olution) and 6 (282239 particles, 3.06 Å resolution). The final maps were sharpened with Local Filtering.
Data on H2AK119ub nucleosomes were processed in cryoSPARC v3.3 ( 47 ).

posures, yielding 10018 high-quality micrographs. An initial round of particle picking was performed using Blob Picker and Inspect Picks, then extracted using Extract from Micro- graphs. A set of 2D templates was created by first perform- ing 2D Classification on the extracted particles then select- ing representative views using Select 2D Classes. These tem- plates were used to perform a second round of particle picking using Template Picker and Inspect Picks, then extracted us- ing Extract from Micrographs to yield an uncleaned particle stack of 1824939 particles. One round of 2D Classification and Select 2D Classes was performed to remove junk parti- cles by discarding distinctly poor quality 2D classes to yield a cleaned particle stack of 895614 particles. We note that itera- tive Ab-Initio Reconstruction jobs for particle cleaning did not improve resolution, so were therefore not used for additional particle cleaning. The particles were aligned along their C2 symmetry axis using the Non-Uniform Refinement job ( 48 ) and then symmetry-expanded, doubling the effective number of particles to 1791228 particles. These particles were used in a local refinement 3D reconstruction to produce a structure with poor density for ubiquitin, showing a blur of lower res- olution density across the surface of the nucleosome. A round of focused 3D classification was performed with a cylindrical focus mask centered on the area of blurred ubiquitin density to yield two distinct ubiquitin positions. An additional round of focused 3D classification was performed for each ubiquitin position using a spherical focus mask centered on each ubiq- uitin position. Individual particle CTF was refined with Local CTF Refinement, image group CTF was refined with Global CTF Refinement, and structures were refined with local re- finement to produce H2AK119 ubiquitin position 1 (102259 particles, 3.41 Å resolution) and position 2 (68407 particles, 3.47 Å resolution). The final maps were sharpened with Local Filtering.
Model building and refinement Initial models of nucleosomes containing H2BK120ub, H2BK120ub + H3K C 79me2, and H2AK119ub were con- structed by rigid-body fitting models for an unmodified nucle- osome (PDB: 4ZUX) and ubiquitin (PDB: 1UBQ) into density maps using ChimeraX ( 49 ), and refined using all-atom flexible refinement with strong restraints in Coot 0.9.6 ( 50 ). Since the particles were subjected to C2 symmetry expansion and 3D classified according to the position of only one of the ubiqui- tin molecules, the ubiquitin was modeled onto only one side of the nucleosome. Histone tails were extended where density was visible. C-terminal tail residues of ubiquitin were omit- ted where density was not visible. The modeled ubiquitin in- cludes residues 1–72 in H2Bub position 4, 1–74 in H2Bub position 5, 1–73 in H2Bub position 6, and 1–73 in H2Aub positions 1 and 2. The DNA of H2BK120ub + H3K C 79me2 nucleosomes was extended from 145 to 157 bp where density was visible to account for the for the extra-nucleosomal linker DNA present in this sample. All models were further refined in PHENIX ( 51 ) using phenix.real_space_refine ( 52 ) and val- idated using the CryoEM Comprehensive Validation module in PHENIX running MolProbity ( 53 ). Figures were generated with ChimeraX ( 49 ).

( 56 ), the back- bone of the ubiquitin-linked K48 in chain B of PDB entry 3NS8 ( 57 ) was aligned with the lysine backbone of histone H2BK120. Next, the sidechain of H2BK120 was rebuilt to have the same geometry as K48 in 3NS8. The ubiquitin C- terminal glycine in chain A of 3NS8 (post-alignment) was then used as the C-terminal glycine of 1UBQ. The unstruc- tured C-terminus of 1UBQ (residues 71–75) was refined us- ing the Modloop server ( 58 ) to connect and refine the C- terminal glycine to the rest of 1UBQ. The covalent bond be- tween H2BK120 and the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin was built using the LEaP program in AMBER20 ( 59 ), resulting in a bond between the neutralized lysine sidechain nitrogen and the glycine carbonyl carbon. The structure was solvated in a truncated octahedron box with periodic boundary condi- tions set to 1.25 nm away from the ubiquitinated nucleosome. Sodium and chloride ions were then added to neutralize the system charge and to reach a final concentration of 150 mM. All simulations were performed using the AMBER ff14SB ( 60 ) force field, including parmbsc1 DNA and CUFIX ion pa- rameter corrections ( 61 ,62 ). These force field parameters have been shown to effectively capture nucleosome dynamics in all-atom MD simulations ( 63 ). All water molecules were de- scribed using a TIP3P water model. For the peptide bond be- tween H2BK120 and the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin, we employed the force field parameters parameterized by Carroll et al ( 56 ).
Simulations were carried out using the CPU version of Particle-Mesh Ewald Molecular Dynamics (PMEMD) in the AMBER20 software ( 59 ). All systems were energy-minimized using a steepest descent gradient method for 10000 steps with −2 positional restraint applied to all heavy a 500 kJ mol atoms. Systems were then equilibrated as described by Armeev −1 et al. ( 63 ): (i) 100 ps with positional restraints of 500 kJ mol −2 with 0.5 fs time step; (ii) 200 ps with positional re- nm −2 with 2 fs time step (and fur- straints of 50 kJ mol ther the same); (iii) 200 ps with positional restraints of 5 kJ −2 and (iv) 200 ps with positional restraints of 0.5 mol −2 ; (v) 200 ps of unrestrained simulations. Sys- kJ mol tems were equilibrated in the canonical (NVT) ensemble, at 300 K and 1 bar using the Langevin thermostat and Parrinello- Rahman barostat. Systems were then simulated with no posi- tional restraints for 1 ns in an isobaric-isothermal (NPT) en- semble at 300 K and 1 bar, using a Langevin thermostat and Monte Carlo barostat (same for production run simulations). All simulations used a 4 fs time step using hydrogen mass repartitioning. Hydrogen bond lengths were constrained us- ing the SHAKE algorithm. The cutoff for non-bonded interac- tions were set to 12.0 Å, and long-range electrostatic interac- tions were computed using the particle mesh EWALD (PME) method. Trajectory frames were written every 50 ps. The pro- duction run was simulated in duplicate for 400 ns, producing a total of 800 ns of simulation time.

The AmberTools CPPTRAJ package ( 64 ) was used to center trajectories. Simulations were visualized using Visual Molec- ular Dynamics (VMD) ( 65 ) and PyMOL. Distance calcula- tions were performed using the MDAnalysis package ( 66 ). To calculate the distance between ubiquitin and the nucleosome acidic patch, the distance between the center of mass of each group was used. The center of mass of ubiquitin was based on the backbone atoms of regions with secondary structure. The acidic patch center of mass was based on the backbone heavy

atoms of the following residues of histone H2A: E61, E64, D90, E91 and E92. The ubiquitin molecules on both faces of the nucleosome were used from each trajectory. The distances sampled between ubiquitin and the acidic patch are presented as a probability distribution function using the seaborn pack- age in python. To generate ubiquitin clusters, we used the K- means clustering algorithm available in the AmberTools CPP- TRAJ package ( 64 ). Using both trajectory replicates, we gen- erated 10 clusters based on the RMSD of the backbone heavy atoms of ubiquitin containing secondary structure. Since there are two ubiquitin molecules on the nucleosome, the ubiquitin molecule that had the highest RMSD was used to generate the RMSD clusters. For the calculation of ubiquitin RMSD, all trajectory frames were aligned to the backbone heavy atoms of the histone octamer core in the cryoEM structure of the ubiquitinated nucleosome.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays Binding reactions were prepared in 12 μl volumes by combin- ing RCC1 and nucleosome in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 5% sucrose, 1 mM DTT, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mg / ml BSA). In competitive binding experiments LANA peptide ( 1–23 ) was also added as a reaction compo- nent. Nucleosome was always added last. Prepared reactions were equilibrated on ice for 1 h. Prior to sample loading, 6% ◦C in 0.25 × Tris– TBE gels were run at 150 V for 60 min at 4 borate–EDTA (TBE) buffer. Then, 10 μl of each equilibrated binding reaction was loaded on a 6% TBE gel and run at 150 ◦C in 0.25 × TBE buffer. Gels were V for 100–120 min at 4 stained in the dark on a rotating shaker for 20 min with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) DNA-intercalating stain diluted to 1:5000, then imaged.
Surface plasmon resonance The affinity of RCC1 for nucleosome was measured on a Bi- acore 8K biosensor (GE Healthcare) by surface plasmon res- onance (SPR). Streptavidin from Streptomyces avidinii (Milli- pore Sigma) corresponding to 2000 response units (RU) was amine-coupled on the utilized flow channels of a CM5 sen- (cid:4) biotinylated 185 bp sor chip. Approximately 200 RU of 5 nucleosome (unmodified, H2AK119ub, or H2BK120ub) was captured directly on flow cell 2 in separate channels. Bind- ing experiments were carried out in HBS-EP + buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween- 20), where RCC1 was used as the analyte and titrated over- flow cells 1 and 2 in 2-fold dilutions. Following a 600 s dissoci- ation, an additional 300 s injection of HBS-EP + buffer served to regenerate the sensor surface. Sensorgrams were double- referenced against the control flow cell and buffer injections. Data from two replicates were fit to a 1:1 steady-state affin- ity binding model using Biacore Insight Evaluation software and plotted in GraphPad Prism. Mean and standard deviation values are shown.
Development of single domain antibodies (VHH) to the nucleosome acidic patch Immunizations were performed at Eurogentec , phage display selection and recombinant expression at QVQ, and final char- acterization at EpiCypher . In brief, two llamas were immu- nized with nucleosomes and Freund’s Complete adjuvant, and boosted on days 28, 43 and 52 with additional immunogen and Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. RNA was harvested from
peripheral blood lymphocytes on day 52, reverse transcribed, single domain antibody (also termed VHH; Variable Heavy Domain of a Heavy chain antibody) cDNAs isolated by PCR, and cloned to VCSM13 phage-display libraries of 2 × 10 9 and 3 × 10 9 transformants. After three rounds of library se- lection to nucleosomes, single-colony phage were isolated and ELISA screened to confirm target binding. Candidate VHH were Sanger sequenced and categorized to families. Chosen VHH (C-terminal 6His-tagged) were sequence verified, ex- pressed as recombinants in BL21 E. coli , purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, and purity confirmed by SDS-PAGE. VHH epitopes were identified / characterized using fully defined nu- cleosomes (WT, PTM + , mutants) in dCypher Alpha ( 67 ) and dCypher Luminex (unpublished data).
dCypher™ luminex nucleosome binding assays Semi-synthetic nucleosomes (Unmodified, Kub1-modified and acidic patch mutated) were separately coupled to satura- tion to distinct magnetic avidin-coated xMAP bead regions ( Luminex ). All handling and incubations of MagPlex beads were performed under subdued lighting. Nucleosome: bead region complexes were adjusted to 1 million beads / ml, multi- plexed, and exchanged into long term storage buffer (10 mM Cacodylate pH 7.5, 0.01% BSA, 0.01% Tween-20, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol) for stor- ◦C. Panel balance and Nucleosome: bead region age at –20 identity were confirmed using anti-dsDNA (EMD Millipore #MAB030; 1 / 5, 1 / 50 and 1 / 500), anti-H3.1 / 2 (Active Motif #61629; 1 / 250, 1 / 1000 and 1 / 4000) and anti-PTM (EMD Millipore #04–263, CST #8240S; both 1 / 250, 1 / 1000 and 1 / 4000).
For the dCypher Luminex assay, the binding of Queries (GST-2XLANA-His6 (hereafter GST-LANA) or VHH), to multiplexed nucleosomes (1000 beads / well: the Targets) was tested by serially diluting the Queries (two-fold: GST-LANA, 1.3 μM–40 pM final; VHH, 2 μM–2 nM final). In brief, 50 μl of multiplexed nucleosome panel was combined with 50 μl query in Luminex buffer (final: 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% NP40, 0.01% BSA, 1 mM DTT) in a black, flat-bottom 96-well plate ( GreinerBio #655900) and incu- bated under subdued lighting for one hr with shaking (800 RPM). Beads were captured / washed twice (100 μl of Lu- minex buffer) on a plate-based magnet. 100 μl of either anti- GST ( Fortis Life Sciences #A190-122A; 1 / 1000) or Luminex buffer was respectively added to GST-LANA or VHH and incubated for 30 min with shaking (800 RPM). Beads were captured / washed twice (100 μl of Luminex buffer) on a plate- based magnet. 100 μl of PE donkey anti-rabbit IgG ( BioLe- gend #406421; 2 ug / ml) for GST-LANA, or PE goat anti- alpaca IgG VHH domain ( Jac kson ImmunoResearc h Labora- tories #128–115-232; 1 / 400) for VHH, was added and incu- bated for 30 min with shaking (800 rpm). After two additional washes, beads were resuspended in 100 μl Luminex buffer and Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) read on a FlexMap3D instrument ( PerkinElmer ), counting a minimum of 50-events per Target. Data were analyzed and visualized in GraphPad Prism 10 . Data are plotted as the mean and standard devia- tion of duplicates. A sigmoidal, four-parameter logistic fit of log transformed VHH (M) fit was used. Representative exper- iments are shown in figures.

Results Ubiquitin conjugated to histone H2B-K120 occludes the nucleosome acidic patch To investigate whether H2BK120ub adopts positions that could interfere with the binding of proteins that inter- act with the nucleosome acidic patch, we determined cry- oEM structures of nucleosome core particles containing Widom 601 DNA (147 bp) and ubiquitinated histone H2B- K120 ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The density maps revealed four distinct positions of ubiquitin on the nucleosome sur- face, denoted H2Bub positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Figure 1 A, Supplementary Figure S2 ). In H2Bub position 1, ubiquitin sits nearest the center of the histone octamer core, and pro- gressively further away in positions 2–4. The global resolu- tion estimates for the EM maps for H2Bub positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 were calculated to be 3.32, 3.33, 3.34, and 3.36 Å, respectively ( Supplementary Figures S3 A–D). The local res- olution of the nucleosome core, at ∼3 Å, was higher than that of the conjugated ubiquitin, at ∼6 Å, indicating greater conformational heterogeneity of the ubiquitin compared to the nucleosome core ( Supplementary Figures S4 A–D). The secondary structure elements of ubiquitin in H2Bub posi- tions 1–3 were sufficiently resolved to unambiguously posi- tion and orient the ubiquitin within the electron density maps ( Supplementary Figures S5 A–C). In all three positions, the ubiquitin beta sheet is oriented towards the nucleosome sur- face, while the alpha helix faces away (Figure 1 B). Given its proximity to the other positions, we modeled the ubiquitin in H2Bub position 4 in a similar orientation relative to the nu- cleosome surface ( Supplementary Figure S5 D).
The ubiquitin in H2Bub positions 1 and 2 occludes large portions of the nucleosome acidic patch, as is evident when viewed in projection (Figure 1 C, D). To quantitate the extent to which ubiquitin in each position occludes the acidic patch, we calculated the buried surface area between the acidic patch and ubiquitin using a range of probe radius values (see Meth- ods). At a probe radius of 5 Å, the acidic patch surface area occluded by ubiquitin in H2Bub positions 1, 2, and 3 is 1235, 891, and 405 Å2 , respectively ( Supplementary Figure S6 A). This trend is generally consistent across buried surface cal- culations performed using larger and smaller probe radii ( Supplementary Figures S6 A, B).
Since methylation of histone H3K79 by DOT1L depends upon prior ubiquitination of histone H2BK120 ( 68 ), both modifications can co-occur on the same nucleosome ( 69 ). To see if this methyl modification affects H2BK120ub positioning on the nucleosome surface, we determined cryoEM structures of a nucleosome containing H2BK120ub, di-methylated his- tone H3-K79 (H3K C 79me2), and Widom 601 DNA with 19 bp linkers (185 bp) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The cryoEM dataset revealed two additional distinct ubiquitin positions on the nucleosome surface, denoted H2Bub positions 5 and

6 (Figures 2 A, B , Supplementary Figure S7 ). The global res- olution estimates for these EM maps were 2.93 and 3.06 Å, respectively ( Supplementary Figures S3 E, F), with a local reso- lution of ∼2.5 Å for the nucleosome core and ∼5 Å for ubiqui- tin ( Supplementary Figures S4 E, F). The ubiquitin in position 5 lies between previously determined H2Bub positions 2 and 3 (Figure 2 C). While the ubiquitin in H2Bub position 6 lies closer to histone H3 than any of the other H2Bub positions, it does not interact directly with H3K C 79me2. The density cor- responding to ubiquitin in positions 5 and 6 was sufficiently well-resolved to unambiguously orient the ubiquitin with its beta sheet oriented towards the nucleosome surface (Figures 2 A, B , Supplementary Figures S5 E, F). As observed for H2Bub positions 1 and 2, the ubiquitin in positions 5 and 6 occludes large portions of the nucleosome acidic patch (Figure 2 D). At a probe radius of 5 Å, the occluded surface area between the acidic patch and ubiquitin in H2Bub positions 5 and 6 is 890 Å2 and 1119 Å2 , respectively ( Supplementary Figures S6 A, B).
Molecular dynamics simulations reveal stability of ubiquitin conjugated to H2B-K120 While our density maps indicate that ubiquitin conjugated to H2BK120 can adopt several discrete positions, these struc- tural snapshots do not provide information on the dynamic motion of ubiquitin on the nucleosome surface. We there- fore used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investi- gate the mobility of ubiquitin in H2BK120ub nucleosomes. We built the H2BK120ub nucleosome system with the ini- tial ubiquitin position at H2Bub position 5, which is approx- imately halfway between H2Bub positions 2 and 3. To gauge whether ubiquitin remained stably positioned over the acidic patch, we monitored the distance between their centers of mass over a 400 ns trajectory (Figure 3 A). Over the course of the simulation, the distance between ubiquitin and the acidic patch varied between 24 and 36 Å (Figure 3 B). Importantly, the ubiquitin primarily sampled conformations near the acidic patch and the distance between the ubiquitin and acidic patch largely remained within 1 Å of the starting ubiquitin posi- tion (Figure 3 B). We note that ubiquitin samples some con- formations farther from the acidic patch over the course of the simulation, as apparent from the local minima at ∼34 Å. This is consistent with our cryoEM data, where H2Bub can sample orientations that occlude the acidic patch to a lesser extent.
To visualize representative structures in the MD simula- tion, we used K-means clustering of ubiquitin throughout the trajectory to obtain representative snapshots consistent with H2Bub positions 3, 4, and 5 (Figure 3 C). We did not see rep- resentative ubiquitin positions corresponding to H2Bub cry- oEM positions 1, 2, and 6, likely because of limited sam- pling time. Overall, the MD simulations are consistent with our structural studies showing that ubiquitin conjugated to H2Bub occludes access to the acidic patch.
Ubiquitin conjugated to histone H2A-K119 minimally occludes the nucleosome acidic patch Ubiquitinated histone H2A-K119 (H2AK119ub) is one of the most abundant PTMs in higher eukaryotes ( 70 ), but its ef- fect on protein binding to the nucleosome has not been ex- plored. To see whether ubiquitin conjugated to H2A-K119 adopts discrete positions, we determined cryoEM structures of the nucleosome core particle containing ubiquitinated histone

H2A-K119 and Widom 601 DNA (147 bp) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The cryoEM dataset revealed two distinct ubiq- uitin positions, denoted H2Aub positions 1 and 2 (Figures 4 A, B , Supplementary Figure S8 ), with global resolution es- timates for the corresponding EM maps of 3.41 and 3.47 Å, respectively ( Supplementary Figures S3 G, H). Similar to the maps for H2BK120ub nucleosome, the local resolution of the H2AK119ub nucleosome core, at ∼3 Å, was higher than for the conjugated ubiquitin, at ∼6 Å ( Supplementary Figures S4 G, H). However, the map resolution was suffi-
cient to unambiguously orient ubiquitin within the EM maps ( Supplementary Figures S5 G, H).
The ubiquitin in H2Aub position 1 binds to the nucleo- some surface over histones H3 and H4, immediately adja- cent to the acidic patch (Figure 4 C). In this position, ubiq- uitin partially overlaps the acidic patch, with an occluded sur- face area of 480 Å2 as measured with a 5 Å probe radius ( Supplementary Figures S6 A, B). The ubiquitin in H2Aub po- sition 2 sits at the nucleosome dyad bound to the nucleosomal DNA terminus, end-on, with the ubiquitin beta-sheet oriented

towards the DNA (Figure 4 B). While the resolution is not suf- ficient to discern side chains, the ubiquitin position is consis- tent with van der Waals interactions between the hydrophobic patch on the ubiquitin beta sheet and the terminal base pair of the wrapping DNA. This ubiquitin position would be incom- patible with a nucleosome embedded within a longer DNA duplex. We note that our attempts to determine the structure of an H2AK119ub nucleosome containing an additional 19
bp of flanking linker DNA (185 bp), which would be expected to prevent association of ubiquitin with the DNA end, were unsuccessful due to aggregation of the particles on cryoEM grids.
Since heterochromatic regions are characterized by chro- matin that is condensed and enriched in H2AK119ub ( 26 ), we explored whether the ubiquitin in H2Aub position 1 could be accommodated within higher-order nucleosome packing.

While the precise nature of inter-nucleosomal interactions in condensed chromatin remains an area of active investi- gation ( 71 ), solution-based experiments, X-ray crystal struc- tures, and cryoEM maps have revealed stacked nucleosomes ( 72–75 ). Modeling using the structure of a compacted tetranu- cleosome ( 72 ) shows that the ubiquitin in H2Aub position 1 can be readily accommodated between two stacked nucleo- somes without steric clash ( Supplementary Figure S9 ). Ubiq- uitin in this position can also accommodate binding of the linker histone H1, which binds to the nucleosome dyad, pro- motes chromatin condensation and is abundant in heterochro- matic regions ( 76 ,77 ). Two ubiquitin molecules from oppos- ing H2AK119ub nucleosomes do not fit between two stacked nucleosomes (PDB: 1ZBB) without steric clash. However, a repositioning of the ubiquitin molecules or stacked nucleo- somes may allow two ubiquitin molecules to fit between two stacked nucleosomes.
Ubiquitin conjugated to histone H2B but not H2A competes with RCC1 binding to nucleosomes RCC1, a Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Ran GEF) ( 78 ), interacts with the nucleosome acidic patch and the ad- jacent DNA in a multivalent fashion ( 14 ). H2BK120ub has been shown to interfere with RCC1 binding to the nucle- osome as assayed in pulldown experiments coupled with mass spectrometry analysis ( 33 ,34 ). It is therefore possible that H2BK120ub occlusion of the acidic patch observed in our structural studies might account for reduced nucleosome binding by RCC1. While the effect of H2AK119ub on RCC1 binding to nucleosomes has not been explored, we speculated this modification would have a minimal effect based on mini- mal occlusion of the acidic patch by H2AK119ub in our cry- oEM structure (Figure 4 ).
We first quantitated the effect of H2BK120ub on RCC1 binding to nucleosomes using electrophoretic mobility shift

assays (EMSA). On unmodified nucleosomes, increasing con- centrations of RCC1 resulted in the formation of two discrete higher molecular weight bands (Figure 5 A), which presumably correspond to 1:1 and 2:1 R CC1:nucleosome complexes. W e confirmed the identify of these bands by showing that they dis- appear in the presence of increasing concentrations of LANA peptide, which binds to the acidic patch ( 13 ) and has been shown to abrogate RCC1 binding ( 79 ) ( Supplementary Figure S10 A). At the highest concentrations of RCC1 (in the ab-
sence of LANA), we observed a high molecular weight smear resulting from non-specific aggregates containing RCC1 and nucleosome (Figure 5 A). We next assayed RCC1 binding to H2BK120ub nucleosomes and found no discrete high molec- ular weight bands corresponding to RCC1:nucleosome com- plexes, although a high molecular weight smear correspond- ing to potential aggregates was visible at the highest RCC1 concentrations (Figure 5 C).

attach ubiquitin to H2B-K120 ( 38 ), we confirmed that ubiq- uitin covalently linked with a native isopeptide bond also dis- rupts formation of the 1:1 and 2:1 RCC1:nucleosome bands ( Supplementary Figure S10 B).
To obtain a more precise measure of the impact of H2BK120ub on RCC1 binding to nucleosomes, we measured equilibrium dissociation constants by surface plasmon reso- nance (SPR). We found that RCC1 binds unmodified nucle-
osome with a K D of 730 ± 100 nM (Figure 5 B), while the affinity for H2BK120ub nucleosomes is far lower, with an es- timated K D greater than 10000 nM (Figure 5 D). This far lower affinity is consistent with the reported role of H2BK120ub in interfering with RCC1 binding to nucleosomes ( 33 ,34 ).
To test whether it is simply the presence of ubiquitin that interferes with binding to nucleosomes, we assayed RCC1 binding to H2AK119ub nucleosomes by EMSA. Increasing

concentrations of RCC1 results in formation of discrete bands corresponding to 1:1 and 2:1 RCC1:H2AK119ub nucleosome complexes (Figure 5 E), similar to those observed in assays of binding to unmodified nucleosome (Figure 5 A). The K D of RCC1 for nucleosomes containing H2AK119ub was mea- sured by SPR to be 540 ± 90 nM (Figure 5 F), similar to the K D of RCC1 for unmodified nucleosomes (Figure 5 B). These results indicate that ubiquitin conjugated to H2AK119 does not interfere with RCC1 binding to the nucleosome, consistent with our cryoEM data showing that ubiquitin in H2AK119ub nucleosomes only partly occludes the nucleosome acidic patch (Figure 4 C).
To further explore the ability of H2BK120ub or H2AK119ub to interfere with nucleosome binding, we compared the effect of these PTMs on additional acidic patch-binding entities. Nucleosome binding by a glutathione- S-transferase-LANA fusion protein (GST-LANA) decreases in the presence of H2BK120ub ( 35 ), while the impact of H2AK119ub has not been explored. We used dCypher™ Luminex (see Materials and methods) to compare the binding of GST-LANA to an unmodified, H2BK120ub, H2AK119ub, and acidic patch mutant H2A(E61A) nucleosome panel in multiplex. As expected, the binding affinity of GST-LANA was significantly weaker on H2BK120ub or H2A(E61A) nucleosomes than on unmodified nucleosomes (Figure 6 A, Supplementary Table S2 ). As observed for RCC1 (Figure 5 E), GST-LANA binding to H2AK119ub nucleosomes was indistinguishable from unmodified nucleosomes (Figure 6 A). We next assayed the effect of H2BK120ub or H2AK119ub on the binding of four single domain antibodies (aka. Vari- able Heavy Domain of a Heavy chain antibodies; VHH) that specifically bind the nucleosome acidic patch (see Materials and methods). As shown in Figures 6 B–E , the H2A(E61A) acidic patch substitution abrogated nucleosome binding by all four VHH (chromatibody, 1E9, 1G1, 1B2), confirming the importance of acidic patch contacts. As observed for RCC1 and GST-LANA, the presence of H2BK120ub sub- stantially reduced VHH-nucleosome binding, while bind- ing to H2AK119ub nucleosomes was indistinguishable from unmodified nucleosomes (Figures 6 B–E). Note that, while the apparent EC50 of the chromatibody is similar for un- modified and ubiquitinated nucleosomes ( Supplementary Table S2 ), the median fluorescence intensity is far lower for H2BK120ub nucleosomes as compared to unmodified or H2AK119ub nucleosomes. Taken together, these results in- dicate that H2BK120ub, but not H2AK119ub, generally in- terferes with nucleosome engagement by acidic patch binding entities.
Discussion
Our results provide a mechanism by which ubiquitin conju- gated to histone H2B-K120 can exclude proteins from the nucleosome. There had been reports that nucleosome bind- ing by human RCC1, yeast SIR3, and the viral LANA pep- tide was disrupted by monoubiquitination of histone H2B- K120 ( 33–35 ). These proteins bind the nucleosome acidic patch ( 13 , 14 , 36 ), leading to the speculation that H2BK120ub may act as a gatekeeper to this cluster of acidic residues in histones H2A / H2B ( 33 , 35 , 81 , 82 ). Our cryoEM maps unex- pectedly showed ubiquitin positioned on the nucleosome in multiple distinct locations that occlude the nucleosome acidic patch, particularly H2Bub positions 1, 2, and 5 (Figures 1 A,
Nucleic Acids Research , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 16
2 A, Supplementary Figure S6 ). The resulting steric clash could explain how H2BK120ub interferes with binding of select proteins to the nucleosome acidic patch ( 2 ). It is also possible that H2BK120ub may inhibit protein binding to other adja- cent nucleosome surfaces, including the H2B C-terminal he- lix. By contrast, cryoEM maps of H2AK119ub nucleosomes revealed only one stable ubiquitin position on the face of the nucleosome, which only partly overlaps the H2A / H2B acidic patch (Figure 4 A, Supplementary Figure S6 ). The observation of multiple stable positions of H2BK120ub that occlude the acidic patch suggests that ubiquitin conjugated to H2BK120 is more likely to interfere with protein binding to the acidic patch than ubiquitin conjugated to H2AK119. The effect of H2B-K120 ubiquitination in disrupting nucleosome binding of unrelated proteins is consistent with the idea that any gate- keeping function of H2BK120ub is steric, and not related to particular folds or sequence motifs.
Although the precise nature of the contacts between ubiq- uitin and the nucleosome could not be resolved, the EM maps for nucleosomes containing H2Bub position 1 and 2 show weak density for ubiquitin residue R74 interacting with nucleosome acidic patch residues H2A-E56 and H2B-E113 ( Supplementary Figures S11 A, B). It is possible these interac- tions help position the ubiquitin on the nucleosome, although we note that there is no density for R74 interaction in den- sity maps corresponding to H2Bub positions 3 through 6. Ubiquitin residue R72 is also in a position where it could po- tentially interact with the acidic patch, particularly in posi- tions 1 and 2. The ubiquitin hydrophobic patch, composed of beta sheet residues L8, I44, and V70 ( 83 ), is a common site of interaction with ubiquitin binding proteins ( 83–85 ). In our cryoEM structures of H2BK120ub nucleosomes, the ubiquitin hydrophobic patch is oriented towards the nucleo- some surface (Figures 1 B and 2A , B ) and could also poten- tially mediate van der Waals contacts with histone residues. H2Bub position 3, in particular, positions the I44 hydropho- bic patch near H2B residues 45–48. Further investigations will be needed to determine which ubiquitin residues are most important for positioning ubiquitin on the nucleosome surface.
Density for ubiquitin conjugated to H2B-K120 had been previously observed in complexes containing additional pro- teins bound to the nucleosome. In reported structures of pro- teins that bind to both the histone octamer and the ubiquitin in H2BK120ub, ubiquitin adopts different positions that de- pend, in each case, on direct interactions with the bound pro- tein ( 86–90 ) ( Supplementary Figure S12 A). A crystal struc- ture of a nucleosome containing H2BK120ub alone did not show density for ubiquitin ( 91 ), indicating either that ubiq- uitin is conformationally heterogeneous in the absence of a bound protein, or that it adopts multiple positions that could not be resolved in the electron density maps. However, a cry- oEM structure of Set2 histone methyltransferase bound to H2BK120ub nucleosome showed EM density for ubiquitin over the acidic patch ( 92 ), in close proximity to H2Bub po- sition 1 in the present study ( Supplementary Figure S12 B). A cryoEM structure of the Chd1 chromatin remodeler bound to H2BK120ub nucleosome with partially unwrapped DNA shows EM density for ubiquitin partially occluding the acidic patch ( 81 ) ( Supplementary Figure S12 B). In those cases, it was not clear if the presence of either Set2 or Chd1, or the partially unwrapped DNA in the latter structure, contributed to ubiqui- tin positioning, although we note that the density maps show

Acidic patch mutation H2A(E61A) and H2BK120ub, but not H2AK119ub, interferes with the binding of GST-LANA ( A ) ( 35 ) and chromatibody VHH ( B ) to nucleosome ( 80 ) in dCypher-Luminex assays (see Methods); measured using median fluorescence intensity (MFI) units. ( C–E ) H2A(E61A) and H2BK120ub, but not H2AK119ub, also interfere with the binding of three newly generated nucleosome acidic patch specific VHH (clones 1E9, 1G1 and 1B2: see Materials and methods).
no evidence of direct interactions between the bound protein, or DNA, and ubiquitin.
The H2BK120ub used in our structural studies contained a non-native dichloroacetone (DCA) linkage between ubiquitin and H2B (see Methods), which is one bond length longer than a native isopeptide linkage ( 93 ). We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the positioning of ubiquitin observed in our structural studies may be due, in part, to unique charac- teristics of the DCA linkage. We note, however, that binding
of RCC1 to nucleosomes is disrupted to the same extent by isopeptide-linked H2BK120ub and DCA-linked H2BK120ub ( Supplementary Figure S10 B). Their similar behavior in so- lution experiments indicates that native-linked ubiquitin be- haves in a manner similar to that of DCA-linked ubiquitin in occluding the nucleosome acidic patch.
We note that the relative residence time of ubiquitin at each observed position cannot be determined from cryoEM maps. While it is most likely that ubiquitin coupled to H2B-K120

has many degrees of freedom and can adopt a large number of positions relative to the nucleosome, our ability to capture discrete snapshots at sufficient resolution to orient the ubiqui- tin suggests it has sufficient residence time at or near the acidic patch to interfere with protein binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of H2BK120ub nucleosomes support our obser- vation that ubiquitin largely remains near the acidic patch (Figures 3 A, B ). Although our MD simulations were able to recapitulate H2Bub positions 3, 4, and 5 observed in our cry- oEM maps, we did not capture positions 1, 2, and 6, suggest- ing that further sampling is required to observe them. Future work using longer simulations or enhanced techniques will be needed to recapitulate other H2Bub positions, and potentially identify metastable states that cannot be captured by cryoEM. Nevertheless, our MD simulations interrogate the dynamics of H2BK120ub and show that the ubiquitin remains positioned at or near the nucleosome acidic patch, thereby occluding this interaction hub.
It is important to note that the histone methyltransferases, DOT1L, Dot1, and COMPASS, are able to bind to the nu- cleosome acidic patch in the presence of ubiquitinated H2B- K120, as they also contain specific elements that bind ubiq- uitin patch ( 35 , 86 , 87 , 94–96 ). The ubiquitin is thus reposi- tioned through energetically favorable interactions with each enzyme, clearing the way for other parts of the protein to contact the nucleosome acidic patch. Such multivalent bind- ing to both ubiquitin and the nucleosome could explain why DOT1L, Dot1, and COMPASS bind specifically to nucleo- somes containing H2BK120ub, while RCC1, Sir3, and LANA, which do not bind ubiquitin, are excluded from the nucleo- some acidic patch by this PTM.
How might the ability of H2BK120ub to control access to the nucleosome acidic patch help orchestrate the complex se- ries of events that take place during transcription initiation and elongation? Histone H2BK120 is dynamically ubiquiti- nated and deubiquitinated during transcription ( 97 ), which enables the conjugated ubiquitin to serve a transient gating function that can be switched off by removal of the ubiqui- tin ( 98 ). While the precise point at which ubiquitin is con- jugated and subsequently removed is not known, the tran- sient presence of H2BK120ub can delimit the period dur- ing which certain acidic patch binders cannot be recruited to the nucleosome. Most chromatin remodeling enzymes must bind to the nucleosome acidic patch to reposition nucleosomes and activate transcription ( 99 ), and can therefore potentially be regulated by ubiquitination of H2B. An example is yeast SWR1C, which exchanges the canonical H2A for histone vari- ant, H2A.Z, and contacts the nucleosome acidic patch, as well as the C-terminus of histone H2B ( 100 ). Intriguingly, ubiq- uitination of H2B and incorporation of the histone variant, H2A.Z, at the +1 nucleosome are anticorrelated ( 101 ), con- sistent with a model in which ubiquitin disrupts SWR1C ac- tivity ( 100 ). The remodeling enzyme, Chd1, is stimulated by H2BK120ub, although the stimulation mechanism may be re- lated to a role for ubiquitin in favoring the unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA in the presence of Chd1 ( 81 ). Further stud- ies will be needed to address the mechanisms underlying the complex roles that H2B ubiquitination plays in transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair.
Monoubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B play op- posing roles in regulating transcription through their interac- tion with enzymes that specifically recognize these modifica- tions, and by promoting or disrupting chromatin compaction

( 16 ,17 ). Our studies shed light on a potential additional mech- anism in which H2BK120ub, but not H2AK119ub, regulates binding to the acidic patch, a hub of nucleosome engagement for diverse chromatin interactors.
