Reversible protein acetylation is a ubiquitous means for the rapid control of diverse cellular processes. Acetyltransferase enzymestransfertheacetylgroupfromacetyl-CoAtolysineres- idues, while deacetylase enzymes catalyze removal of the acetyl group by hydrolysis or by an NAD(cid:1)-dependent reaction. Propi- onyl-coenzyme A (CoA), like acetyl-CoA, is a high energy prod- uct of fatty acid metabolism and is produced through a similar chemical reaction. Because acetyl-CoA is the donor molecule for protein acetylation, we investigated whether proteins can be propionylated in vivo, using propionyl-CoA as the donor mole- cule. We report that the Salmonella enterica propionyl-CoA synthetase enzyme PrpE is propionylated in vivo at lysine 592; propionylation inactivates PrpE. The propionyl-lysine modifi- cation is introduced by bacterial Gcn-5-related N-acetyltrans- feraseenzymesandcanberemovedbybacterialandhumanSir2 enzymes (sirtuins). Like the sirtuin deacetylation reaction, sir- tuin-catalyzed depropionylation is NAD(cid:1)-dependent and pro- duces a byproduct, O-propionyl ADP-ribose, analogous to the O-acetyl ADP-ribose sirtuin product of deacetylation. Only a subset of the human sirtuins with deacetylase activity could also depropionylate substrate. The regulation of cellular propionyl- CoA by propionylation of PrpE parallels regulation of acetyl- CoA by acetylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase and raises the possibility that propionylation may serve as a regulatory modification in higher organisms.
acetyl group donor. In higher organisms, aberrant acetylation oflysineresiduesinhistonetailscorrelateswithdiseasessuchas cancers and developmental disorders and may contribute to modulation of cell life span (3, 4). From bacteria to humans, N-Lys acetylation controls the activity of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (AMP-forming; Acs) and potentially that of other members of the AMP-forming family of enzymes (5–7). In Sal- monella enterica, Acs is deacetylated by CobB, a member of the Sir2 family of NAD(cid:1)-dependent deacetylases (a.k.a. sirtuins) (8).Interestingly,strainsofS.entericalackingCobBdeacetylase activitycannotgrowonpropionatebecausethepropionyl-CoA synthetase (encoded by the prpE gene) that activates propio- nate to propionyl-CoA is not active (5, 9).
Cells generate propionyl-CoA from several different pro- cesses, including the catabolism of odd chain fatty acids, the decarboxylation of succinate, the catabolism of amino acids (e.g. threonine), and the activation of propionate (10–12). Pro- pionate is a powerful inhibitor of cell growth that is widely used as a food preservative. Reports in the literature suggest that propionyl-CoA may be responsible for the cytotoxic effects of propionate. Although the direct effects of propionyl-CoA are unclear, it is clear that cells avoid accumulating this metabolite (13–15). The cell maintains low levels of propionyl-CoA by using it as a source of carbon and energy. The predominant pathway for propionate degradation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the 2-methylcitric acid cycle, which converts pro- pionate to pyruvate via reactions similar to those of the Krebs cycle (supplemental Fig. S6) (16, 17).
Protein acetylation is a ubiquitous means for the rapid con- trol of diverse cellular processes (1, 2). Acetylation occurs at lysine residues, with acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA)5 serving as the

Propionylated lysine residues were recently identified in his- tones (18, 19); by analogy with histone acetylation, propionyl- CoAispresumablyrequiredasapropionyldonor.However,the physiological lysine propionylation was unknown. We report here that the propionyl-CoA synthetase (PrpE) enzyme of S. enterica is reversibly propionylated in vivo and that this modification regulates enzymatic activity. The modification is removed by the S. enterica sirtuin CobB in an NAD(cid:1)-dependent reaction that mirrors the sirtuin deacetyla- tion reaction. Our results suggest that propionylation/depro- pionylation may be a conserved regulatory mechanism in higher organisms and that acylation/deacylation systems for the control of acyl:CoA (AMP-forming) ligases may be a gen- eral mechanism for maintaining CoA homeostasis in all cells.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
ProteinPurification
Protein Purity Assessment—Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE (20) and visualized with Coomassie Blue (21). Purity was assessed by band densitometry using a Fotodyne imaging system with Foto/Analyst v.5.00 software (Fotodyne Inc) for image acquisition and TotalLab v.2005 software for analysis (Nonlinear Dynamics).
S. enterica PrpEWT and PrpEK592E Proteins—These proteins
were purified by chitin purification as described (11).
Pat—GST-H6-Protein Acetyltransferase (Pat) was overpro- duced as described (22). The Pat used in all experiments except the propionylation and depropionylation time courses was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography as described (22) and was 32% homogeneous. Pat used for time courses was purified by affinity chromatography using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column on an A¨KTA FPLC Purifier system (Amersham Bio- sciences). Cells expressing GST-H6-Pat were harvested by cen- trifugation at 10,500 (cid:2) g for 12 min in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20 XOI refrigerated centrifuge with a JLA-8.1000 rotor. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5, at 24 °C), NaCl (0.5 M), imidazole (20 mM)) and broken by sonication using a 550 Sonic Dismembra- tor (Fisher Scientific) for 3 min (50% duty). After equilibration with buffer A and loading of cell-free extract, the column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A, followed by 40 ml of 8% buffer B (sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5, at 24 °C), NaCl (0.5 M), imidazole (0.5 M)). A 50-ml linear gradient increased buffer B to 100%. GST-H6-Pat eluted at (cid:3)40% buffer B and was 67% pure. GST-H6-Pat was stored in tris(hydroxymethyl)amin- omethanebuffer(Tris-HCl,50mM,pH7.5,at25 °C)containing KCl (100 mM) and 50% glycerol (v/v) at 4 °C.
CobB Sirtuin—Synthesis of CobB sirtuin fused to an N-ter- minal chitin binding tag was directed by plasmid pCOBB31 (supplementalTableS1)inEscherichia colistrainER2566(New England Biolabs). Cells were grown at 25 °C in two liters of lysogenic broth (23, 24) supplemented with ampicillin (100 (cid:1)g/ml) and ZnSO4 (50 (cid:1)M). Gene expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-(cid:2)-D-thiogalactoside to 1 mM at A600 (cid:3) 0.4. Cells were grown overnight at 25 °C, harvested by centrifu- gation at 10,500 (cid:2) g for 12 min as described above, and broken using a chilled French pressure cell (Spectronic Instruments; twopassesat1.3kPa).Proteinwaspurifiedandthetagremoved using the standard protocol for the IMPACT-CN Protein Fusion and Purification System (New England Biolabs). Cell- freeextractwasincubatedwithchitinbeadsfor1hat4 °Cprior to column preparation. After tag removal, CobB protein was stored in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) containing KCl (100 mM) and 50% glycerol (v/v) at (cid:4)80 °C.
PncA Nicotinamidase—S. enterica pncA was amplified using primers to add 5(cid:5)-KpnI and 3(cid:5)-HindIII restriction sites and cloned into plasmid pTEV6 cut with the same enzymes to yield plasmid pPNC2 (supplemental Table S1), which encodes PncA protein with an N-terminal maltose-binding protein-hexahis- tidine (MBP-H6) tag. Plasmid pPNC2 was moved into E. coli strainBL21((cid:3)DE3)byelectroporation(25).Theresultingstrain wasgrownovernightandsubcultured1:100(v/v)into2litersof

PncA eluted at (cid:3)30% buffer B. MBP-H6-PncA-containingfractionswerepooledandH6-rTEV protease (26) added to reach a 1:50 H6-rTEV protease:MBP- H6-PncA ratio; H6-rTEV protease was purified as described (27). The cleavage reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h and dialyzed overnight against two liters of buffer A at 4 °C. Tagless PncA protein (83% pure) was resolved from the reaction mixture using the 5-ml HisTrap HP column, which did not bind tagless PncA. Protein was stored in Tris- HCl(50mM,pH7.5,at25 °C)containingKCl(100mM)and20% (v/v) glycerol at (cid:4)80 °C.

Human Proteins—Human SIRT1 protein was a gift from John Denu. Human SIRT2 and SIRT3 were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21((cid:3)DE3) transformed with plasmids SIRT2- pHEX and SIRT3-pQE-80, respectively (6, 28). Cells were grown in 1 liter of lysogenic broth supplemented with ampicil- lin (100 (cid:1)g/ml) and ZnSO4 (50 (cid:1)M) at 37 °C toA 600 (cid:3) 0.7. Pro- tein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-(cid:2)-D-galac- topyranoside (1 mM), and cultures were grown overnight at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and broken by sonication, and hSirT2 and hSirT3 were purified using His- Bind Quick 900 cartridges (Novagen) according to the manu- facturer’s instructions. Proteins were dialyzed into storage buffer (Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 20% glycerol (v/v)) and stored at (cid:4)20 °C. hSirT2proteinwas52%pure,andhSirT3proteinwas49%pure. Other Proteins—Bacillus subtilis AcuA, Thermotoga mari- timaSir2,humanSIRT4,andmurineSIRT1proteinswerepuri- fied as described (29–31).

mM)) (32). Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and visu- alized after staining with Coomassie Blue. Gels were dried and exposed overnight to a MultiPurpose Phosphor Screen (Pack- ard). Radiolabeled proteins were identified by phosphorimag- ing using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard) and OptiQuant v 04.00 software (Packard).
Propionylation Time Courses—Propionylation reactions were performed as described above with either PrpE (62.5 pmol) and GST-H6-Pat (31.3 pmol) or PrpE (37.5 pmol) and AcuA (18.7 pmol) added/25 (cid:1)l. Samples (25 (cid:1)l) were removed at designated times and stopped by addition of gel loading buffer. Proteins were separated by 4–15% SDS-PAGE. Radiola- beled proteins were quantified with respect to a standard curve using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard) and Opti- Quant v 04.00 software (Packard).
Depropionylation Time Courses—Propionylation reactions were performed as described above with PrpE (62.5 pmol) and GST-H6-Pat(31.3pmol)added/25(cid:1)l.After2hofincubationat 37 °C, GST-H6-Pat was removed using GST-Mag(cid:2)-agarose beads (Novagen).

Radiolabeled proteins were quantitated as described above.
Propionyl-CoA Synthetase—PrpE (62.5 pmol) was incubated with Pat (62.5 pmol) and 20 (cid:1)M Pr-CoA, Ac-CoA, or CoA for 6 h at 37 °C. Reaction conditions were as described above. PrpE activity was determined using a coupled assay to link AMP for- mationtoNADHoxidation(11,33).Reactions(1ml)contained HEPES (50 mM, pH 7.5, at 25 °C), CoA (1 mM), phosphoenol- pyruvate (3 mM), ATP (1 mM), MgCl2 (200 (cid:1)M), NADH (260 (cid:1)M), lactate dehydrogenase (10 units; Sigma), pyruvate kinase (10 units; Sigma), myokinase (10 units; Sigma), and PrpE (62.5 pmol). Reactions were started by addition of sodium propio- nate (20 (cid:1)M). Absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 20 min using a PerkinElmer Lambda 40 UV-visible spectrophotome- ter. Specific activities were calculated using the molar extinction (cid:4)1 cm(cid:4)1)(34);twomolesofNADH coefficientofNADH(6,220 M were oxidized per mole of AMP produced. Specific activities are reported as (cid:1)mol of AMP produced/min/mg of protein and are averaged from three independent determinations.
InVivoModificationofPrpE
The prpE gene was amplified from plasmid pPRP68 (35), adding 5(cid:5)-NheI and 3(cid:5)-EcoRI sites, and ligated into plasmid pTYB12(Novagen)cutwithSpeIandEcoRI.Theresultingplas- mid, pPRP211, was used to produce PrpE with an N-terminal chitin-binding domain in strains JE9221 ((cid:6)acs (cid:6)cobB/pTARA rpo(cid:1)/pPRP211prpE(cid:1))andJE9225((cid:6)acs(cid:6)cobBpat/pTARAT7 rpo(cid:1)/pPRP211 prpE(cid:1)).
Strains JE9221 and JE91125 were grown at 37 °C in 250 ml of no-carbon essential medium (36) supplemented with propio- nate (30 mM), glycerol (0.5 mM), MgSO4 (1 mM), L-methionine (0.5 mM), ampicillin (100 (cid:1)g/ml), chloramphenicol (12.5 (cid:1)g/ml). L((cid:1))-Arabinose (250 (cid:1)M) was added at A600 (cid:3) 0.6 to induce expression of T7 polymerase from plasmid pTARA and subsequent PrpE production. PrpE was purified by chitin affin- ity chromatography and resolved by SDS-PAGE. MALDI-TOF peptide fingerprinting was used to identify the modification.

MALDI-TOFPeptideFingerprinting
In-gel digest and MALDI-TOF analysis of PrpE proteins were performed at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Uni- versity of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. PrpE proteins were excised, destained, and dehydrated and then reduced with dithiothreitol (25 mM) for 30 min at 56 °C, alky- lated with iodoacetamide (55 mM) in darkness at room temper- ature for 30 min, and digested with 0.4 (cid:1)g of trypsin (Promega Sequence Grade Modified) overnight at 37 °C. All steps were performed in (NH4)HCO3 (25 mM, pH 8). Resulting peptides wereextractedwith0.1%trifluoroaceticacid(TFA)followedby acetonitrile/H2O/TFA (70%:25%:5%, v/v). Peptides were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo), resuspended in 20 (cid:1)l of TFA (0.1%, v/v), and solid phase extracted using ZipTip(cid:2) (cid:1)C18 pipette tips (Millipore). Peptides were eluted off the C18 col- umn with acetonitrile/H2O/TFA (70%:25%:0.2%, v/v) onto an AnchorChipTM plate (Bruker Daltonics) and recrystallized with 1 (cid:1)l of matrix (20 mg/ml of (cid:4)-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/H2O/TFA (70%:25%:0.2%, v/v)). Peptide finger- print analysis was performed on a Bruker BIFLEX III MALDI- TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Peptide mapping analysis was performed with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science).
MS/MS analysis was performed at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center using a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in positive ion mode.

RESULTS
Previously published work (9) suggested that the Pat acetyl- transferase and CobB deacetylase modulated the activity of PrpE in vivo. When tested in vitro, the S. enterica Pat enzyme acetylated or propionylated PrpE, whereas the CobB sirtuin deacetylatedPrpEAcordepropionylatedPrpEPr(Fig.1A,lane2, rows II and IV). Because both PrpE and Acs contain a P-X4-GK motif in which the lysine residue is critical for function (5, 11), we reasoned that this lysine could be the modified residue, by analogy with Acs (5). Failure of Pat to acetylate a PrpEK592E mutant (Fig. 1A, lane 1, rows II and IV) was consistent with the hypothesis that Lys-592 was indeed the modification site of PrpE. This result was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spec- trometry peptide fingerprinting studies. The mass spectrum of PrpE incubated with Pat and propionyl-CoA, then cut with trypsin, included a signal at m/z (cid:7) 747.4 atomic mass units, matching the mass of the S590GKPrMLR peptide (sup- plemental Fig. S7A). Similarly, mass spectrometry of PrpE incubated with Pat and acetyl-CoA gave a signal matching that of the S590GKAcMLR peptide (supplemental Fig. S7B; m/z (cid:7) 733.5 atomic mass units). Peptides containing Lys- 592 were not present in the mass spectrum of tryptic digest of PrpE after incubation with Pat and CoA (supplemental Fig. S7C). Cleavage after Lys-592 should result in the pep- tides S590GK (m/z (cid:7) 291.1 atomic mass units) and M593LR (m/z (cid:7) 419.2 atomic mass units), as long as Lys-592 was not modified. The above-mentioned peptides were not observed. Activity assays showed that propionylation of PrpE resulted in (cid:3)70% loss of specific activity (1.5 (cid:1) 0.3 (cid:1)mol AMP min(cid:4)1 mg(cid:4)1) relative to that of unmodified PrpE enzyme (5 (cid:1) 0.9 (cid:1)mol AMP min(cid:4)1 mg(cid:4)1).

Time courses were performed in triplicate. Graphs depict the mean and range of values for each time point.
To determine whether PrpE was posttranslationally modi- fied in vivo, we isolated PrpE protein from strains grown on propionate. The strains used in these experiments were JE9221 ((cid:6)acs (cid:6)cobB/pprpE(cid:1)) and JE9225 ((cid:6)acs (cid:6)cobB pat/pprpE(cid:1)) (supplementalTableS1).OurstrategywastooverproducePrpE in the absence of the CobB sirtuin to allow Pat-dependent acylation and subsequent accumulation of PrpE in its acy- lated form. Both strains grew on propionate, albeit poorly, because the acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase system was functional (9). We did not expect PrpE to be modified in strain JE9225 ((cid:6)acs (cid:6)cobB pat/pprpE(cid:1)) because the pat gene was inactive in this strain; hence PrpE from strain JE9225 was used as a negative control. In agreement with this pre- diction, strain JE9225 grew much better on propionate (dou- bling time (cid:7) 5.5 h) than did strain JE9221 (doubling time (cid:7) 15.8 h), suggesting that Pat inactivated PrpE in strain JE9221 (supplemental Fig. S8).
The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of tryptic peptides of PrpE isolated from strain JE9221 ((cid:6)acs (cid:6)cobB/pprpE(cid:1)) contained a signal at m/z (cid:7) 747.4 atomic mass units (Fig. 1B). The MS/MS fragmentationpatternofthem/z(cid:7)747.4peptidematchedthat expected for S590GKPrMLR (supplemental Table S3) as well as thatobservedforasyntheticSGKPrMLRpeptide(supplemental Fig. S9). The peptide fingerprint of PrpE protein isolated from strain JE9225 ((cid:6)acs (cid:6)cobB pat/pprpE(cid:1)) matched that of PrpE treated with CoA and did not contain any signals for modified peptides (Fig. 1C). Although a very small peak was seen at m/z (cid:7) 747.4, MS/MS fragmentation analysis showed it to be an isotope of the m/z (cid:7) 745.4 peptide (supplemental Fig. S10). These results demonstrated that Pat was responsible for the propionylation of PrpE in vivo.
We investigated whether other acetyltransferase enzymes could propionylate PrpE. The Gcn-5-related N-acetyltrans- ferase enzyme AcuA from B. subtilis (29) displayed propiony- lationactivitywiththespecificactivityofAcuA(78.4pmolPrpE propionylated min(cid:4)1 (cid:1)mol(cid:4)1) 5.5 times higher than that of Pat (14.3 pmol PrpE propionylated min(cid:4)1 (cid:1)mol(cid:4)1) (Fig. 2).

The reaction mixture contained NAD(cid:1) (1 mM) and nicotinaminidase (PncA)addedtoreactions.Timecourseswereperformedintriplicatewiththe exception of the hSirT2 time course, which was performed in duplicate.

Because deletion of the cobB gene encoding the S. enterica sirtuin inactivates PrpE in vivo, we asked whether the CobB sirtuin depropionylates substrates in vitro. As predicted, the S. enterica CobB sirtuin was able to remove the propionyl modification from PrpE (specific activity (cid:7) 3.1 pmol PrpE depropionylated min(cid:4)1 (cid:1)mol(cid:4)1 CobB) (Fig. 1A, lane 1, row IV, and Fig. 3B). We next asked whether other bacterial and eukaryotic sirtuins had depropionylase activity. The human SIRT2 (hSirT2) and SIRT3 (hSirT3) and the bacterial T. maritima Sir2 (Sir2Tm) proteins depropionylated PrpEPr within 1 h (Fig. 3, C–E). Depropionylase activity was not observed with human (hSirT1) or murine SIRT1 (mSirT1) or human SIRT4 (hSirT4) (Fig. 3A, lanes 3, 4, 7). However, mSirT1 displayed robust deacetylase activity (17.6 (cid:1) 0.4 pmol PrpE deacetylated min(cid:4)1 (cid:1)mol(cid:4)1 mSirT1), suggesting that the lack of depropionylase activity of mSirT1 arises from

specific discrimination between acetyl and propionyl lysine rather than being due simply to absence of any enzymatic activity (data not shown).
Byanalogywiththedeacetylationreaction,wepredictedthat sirtuin-mediated depropionylation would produce OPADPR. OPADPR has been shown to be the product of the sirtuin-cat- alyzed reaction when synthetic propionylated peptides were used as substrates (39).
WedevelopedasystemfortheinsitugenerationofOPADPR through iterative propionylation and depropionylation of pro- tein substrate. Reaction mixtures contained AcuABs in lieu of Pat because of the former’s higher propionylase activity and because its smaller size allowed us to use higher enzyme con- centrations. A peptide consisting of the C-terminal 52 amino acids of AcsSe was used as protein substrate because it could be added at higher concentration than PrpE. Results of a control experiment verified that AcuABs propionylated the 52-amino acid peptide (supplemental Fig. S11). To prevent inhibition of the sirtuin activity by nicotinamide, all reaction mixtures con- tained PncA nicotinamidase (supplemental Fig. S12). Reaction mixtures were resolved by C18 reverse-phase HPLC. The large NAD(cid:1) peak (t (cid:7) 29.5 min) observed in the chromatogram of control mixture lacking CobB sirtuin was absent in the chro- matogram of the mixture containing CobB (Fig. 4A, dashed line). The compound eluting 36.5 min post-injection was OPADPR ((M-H)(cid:4) ion; m/z (cid:7) 614.1 atomic mass units) as determined by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4B). Reaction byprod- ucts were identified using authentic standards (nicotinic acid, 5.8 min; ADP-ribose, 3.8 min). To catalyze lysine depropiony- lation in a manner analogous to the sirtuin deacetylation reac- tion, the enzyme must be able to accommodate the additional methylgroupintheMichaeliscomplexformedwithNAD(cid:1)and the propionylated peptide. We therefore modeled the complex based on the structure of NAD(cid:1) and an acetylated peptide bound to Sir2Tm (40), a bacterial sirtuin that exhibits depropio- nylation activity (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 5, the structure can readilyaccommodatetheadditionalmethylofpropionyl-lysine in a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme active site. A model constructed with no adjustments produced minimal clashes (van der Waals distances of 3.2 Å or greater) that were com- pletely eliminated during energy minimization by minor side- chainrearrangements,withindividualatomicshiftsoflessthan 0.2 Å, in the vicinity of the propionyl-lysine.
DISCUSSION
Taken together, the data presented here support the conclu- sion that N-Lys propionylation is a physiologically relevant posttranslational modification for the control of protein func- tion. Because propionylase activity was detectable in two bac- terial Gcn-5-related N-acetyltransferase enzymes (S. enterica Pat,B.subtilisAcuA),wesuggestthatmembersofthisfamilyof enzymesinhigherorganismsmayalsohavepropionylaseactiv- ity. Similarly, robust depropionylase activity is found among sirtuins from bacteria and higher organisms (Fig. 3), suggesting thatothermembersofthisenzymefamilymayalsocatalyzethis activity. However, because this activity was not detected in human or murine SIRT1 or human SIRT4 enzymes, the ability to accommodate the larger propionyl modification in the

onyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA via rate-limiting steps of the 2-meth- ylcitric acid cycle (supplemental Fig. S6) (16). This strategy would make inactivation of propionyl-CoAsynthetasetooslow to prevent any imbalance in CoA homeostasis or to prevent other toxic effects caused by high levels of propionyl-CoA (13). The cell therefore senses propionyl-CoA imbalance directly using the same enzyme pair used to control acetyl-CoA homeostasis.
FIGURE5.Modelofpropionyl-lysineandNAD(cid:1)boundintheSir2Tmactive site. A model of propionyl-lysine in the active site of a sirtuin was modeled based on the structure of the ternary complex formed by the bacterial sirtuin Sir2Tm with NAD(cid:1) and an acetylated peptide (Protein Data Bank code 2H4F) (40). The acetyl group was replaced with the propionyl group and the structure modeled using the molecular graphics program Quanta (2006 edition). Initial fits were achieved with minimal clashing, but an improvedmodelwasobtainedfromaminimizationcalculationperformedin Quanta using the CHARMM force field. Only minor rearrangements of side chains within the Sir2Tm active site were needed to accommodate the addi- tional methyl in the propionyl group. The propionylated peptide fit into a small hydrophobic pocket comprised of the Leu-100, Leu-159, and Phe-148 side chains and backbone atoms of Val-160 and His-116.
From a broader physiological perspective, all cells must con- trol their pools of acyl-CoAs to avoid depletion of the pool of free CoA and/or synthesis of toxic metabolites (13, 44). This suggests, by analogy with the work reported here and with ear- lier findings regarding acetyl CoA homeostasis (8), that there mightwellbeotheracyltransferase/deacylasesystemsthatcells from all domains of life use to control the activity of acyl- CoA synthetases. For example, a succinyl-CoA:protein suc- cinyltransferase enzyme might use succinyl-CoA to inacti- vate the succinate:CoA ligase, while a cognate desuccinylase would reactivate succinyl-CoA ligase. Whether these modi- fications indeed exist in the cell and, like acetylation, are used to regulate other processes is an intriguing possibility under active investigation.
enzyme active site appears to be enzyme-specific. Consistent with the current understanding of the CobB sirtuin-catalyzed deacetylase reaction, the product of the depropionylase activity of CobB was OPADPR (Fig. 4). It is unclear whether OPADPR plays any physiological role as has been suggested for the related molecule O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (41–43).
From a physiological standpoint, propionylation is a logical means of posttranslational regulation because it allows the cell to rapidly modulate activity of propionyl-CoA synthetase in direct response to potentially deleterious levels of its product, propionyl-CoA. In contrast, control of propionyl-CoA synthe- tase activity by acetylation would require conversion of propi-
