Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in nico- tinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis. In the extracellular compartment, it exhibits cytokine-/adipokinelike properties, suggesting that it stands at the crossroad between metabolism and inflammation. Here we show that both intracellular and extracellular NAMPT levels are increased in cells and plasma of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The extracellular form (eNAMPT) is produced by CLL lymphocytes upon B-cell receptor,Toll-likereceptor,andnuclearfactorkB(NF-kB)signalingpathwayactivation. eNAMPT is important for differentiation of resting monocytes, polarizing them toward tumor-supporting M2 macrophages. These cells express high levels of CD163, CD206, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and secrete immunosuppressive (interleukin [IL] 10, CC chemokine ligand 18) and tumor-promoting (IL-6, IL-8) cytokines. NAMPT-primed M2 macrophages activate extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and NF-kB signaling; promote leukemic cell survival; and reduce T-cellresponses.These effectsare independentoftheenzymaticactivityofNAMPT,asinferredfromtheuseofanenzymaticallyinactive mutant. Overall, these results reveal that eNAMPT is a critical element in the induction of an immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting microenvironment of CLL. (Blood. 2015;125(1):111-123)
Key Points
(cid:129) CLL lymphocytes show high intracellular and extracellular NAMPT levels, further increased upon activation. (cid:129) eNAMPT prompts differentiation of CLL monocytes into M2 macrophages that sustain CLL survival and reduce T-cell proliferation.
Introduction
Besidesbeingtheﬁrstlineofdefenseagainstpathogens,macrophages orchestrate tissue plasticity and homeostasis. Theyare classiﬁed into classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, reﬂectingadifferent functional role.1Incancertissues,macrophages tend to be of the M2 phenotype, acquired and maintained through multiple interactions with tumor cells.2 Evidence indicates that these macrophages enhance tumor progression, mainly through the secretion ofchemokines/cytokinesthatsustainneoplasticthecellproliferation and suppress immune responses.3,4

exerting insulinlike properties.18 The unexpected ﬁnding that the sameproteinpossessedsigniﬁcanthomologywithabacterialenzyme, termed NadV, turned NAMPT into a unique enzyme-cytokine molecule.19,20 NAMPT utilizes 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and nicotinamide to generate nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is subsequently adenylated to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) by the enzyme NMN adenylyltransferase. The NAMPT-catalyzed reaction is considered the rate-limiting step in NAD biosynthesis from nicotinamide.20,21 The cytokinelike func- tions of NAMPT prevail in the extracellular environment, where the enzymatic activity seems to be dispensable.22,23 Extracellular NAMPT levels are increased in various metabolic and inﬂammatory diseases,24,25 as well as in tumors,26-29 rendering this pleiotropic molecule a novel player in tumor/host cross-talk.

Results
Intracellular NAMPT (iNAMPT) is overexpressed in CLL cells and is enzymatically active
NAMPT messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in lysates of CLL and normal B lymphocytes were comparatively investigated byqRT-PCRandwesternblot.NAMPTmRNAlevelsinpuriﬁedCLL cells were signiﬁcantly higher than those of normal B lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of age- and sex-matched donors (Figure 1A). Analysis of protein levels in whole cell lysates con- ﬁrmed higher levels of iNAMPT in puriﬁed CLL compared with normalcirculatingBcells(Figure1B).Accordingly,theactivityofthe enzymewashigherinCLLthaninnormalBlymphocytes(Figure1C). In keeping with the NAMPT activity proﬁle, CLL cells also con- tained higher NMN and NAD levels than normal B lymphocytes (Figure 1D). The NAD/NMN ratio was constant and similar in all cells tested (Figure 1E), conﬁrming that the enzyme converting NMN toNAD(ie,NMNadenylyltransferase)isnottherate-limitingenzyme in the nicotinamide-NAD pathway.44
When CLL signaling pathways were activated, NAMPT mRNA wassigniﬁcantlyupregulated.TheincreaseinNAMPT mRNAcould be highlighted after engagement of B-cell receptor (BCR), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), CD38, and CD40 (24 hours, Figure 1F). These signals are known to induce CLL cell activation and CCL3 gene transcription,45,46asconﬁrmedhere(supplementalFigure1A).Higher levels of NAMPT mRNA were paralleled by increased intracellular protein (Figure 1G).TreatmentofactivatedCLL cellswith ibrutinib, a selective bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, abrogated BCR-, TLR9-, and CD38-induced NAMPT mRNA and protein upregulation (Figure 1F-G and supplemental Figure 1B-C), conﬁrming that BTK isacriticalintermediateinthesesignalingpathways47,48andlinkingthis kinase with NAMPT transcription. In the conditions used49 (10 mM dose, 24 hours), we detected complete inhibition of BTK phosphor- ylation, with limited cytotoxicity (supplemental Figure 1D-E).
NAMPT is present in plasma and can be secreted by activated CLL cells
We then asked whether NAMPT protein could also be found in the extracellular environment (eNAMPT). By using an ELISA assay, eNAMPT was detected in the plasma of CLL patients (n 5 130) at signiﬁcantly higher concentrations than in HDs of a comparable age (Figure 2A). The ﬁnding of a positive correlation between NAMPT mRNAexpressioninpuriﬁedCLLcellsandeNAMPTlevelsinplasma (Figure 2B) suggested that leukemic lymphocytes may contribute to the production of eNAMPT. Consistently, a positive correlation
ROLE OF NAMPT IN THE CLL MICROENVIRONMENT
between plasmatic NAMPT and absolute lymphocytosis was ob- served in CLL patients with comparable percentages of circulating monocytes, known contributors to NAMPT secretion (Figure 2C).50 CultureofCLLcellsfor24hourswasfollowedbytheappearance ofeNAMPTinspentmedia(Figure2D),independentlyofthenumber ofcellsundergoingapoptosisorproliferation,evincinganactiverather thanapassivemechanism (notshown).Furthermore, afteractivation of puriﬁed CLL lymphocytes through the BCR, TLR9, CD38, or CD40 for 24 hours, eNAMPT levels were invariably increased (Figure 2D). No signiﬁcant modiﬁcation in the total number of cells was apparent at this time point. The nature of the protein present in CLL plasma or culture supernatants (Figure 2E and supplemental Figure 2A) was conﬁrmed by western blot, showing a protein com- patible with NAMPT selectively in eNAMPT-rich samples. Further- more,deprivation of eNAMPT by immunoprecipitation was followed by the disappearance of the western blot band (Figure 2E).
These results suggest that eNAMPT could derive, at least partly, from leukemic cells. The generation of eNAMPT from CLL cells is apparent under resting conditions and increases upon activation, arguing in favor of a role for this cytokine/enzyme in the CLL microenvironment.
The critical issue in the ﬁeld is whether eNAMPT is enzymati- cally active and whether this activity is relevant in the extracellular compartment.22,51,52 Using an ad hoc devised assay,34 we detected NMNproductionwhenCLLplasmawasincubatedwithnicotinamide andPRPP(Figure2F),withanactivityof1.760.1pmolNMN/hour per mL plasma. However, in the absence of added nicotinamide and PRPP, NAMPT activity was undetectable, in line with previous studies.53 Accordingly,NMN, theproductofthereaction, was unde- tectable in both plasma and media (supplemental Figure 2B).
Treatment of CLL monocytes with NAMPT induces M2 macrophage differentiation
Next we analyzed the functional role of eNAMPT in the CLL micro- environment. Exposure of puriﬁed CLL cells to rNAMPT did not result in increased proliferation or chemotaxis, but it signiﬁcantly enhancedsurvivaloftheleukemiccells(supplementalFigure3A-C). The protective effect may be explained by de novo transcription of TNF-a(supplemental Figure3D),whichisinvolvedinantiapoptotic effects through the activation of B cell activating factor and a pro- liferation inducing ligand.54,55 Conversely, the increased transcription of TGF-b and of CCL3 (supplemental Figure 3E-F) in response to rNAMPT argued in favor of a “microenvironmental effect” of eNAMPT. This later hypothesis is in agreement with previous data implicating the molecule in the differentiation and activation of monocytes.56-58
For this reason, we further investigated whether eNAMPT pro- ducedbyactivatedleukemiccellsmodiﬁesthemyeloidcomponent. After 5 days of exposure to rNAMPT, PBMCs from normal donors showed a signiﬁcant increase in CD11b1 macrophages (supple- mental Figure 4A-C). This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed using PBMCs of CLL patients. Macrophage increases were substantiated by Giemsa staining (highlighting typical intracellular vacuoles and granules) and by CD11b and CD68 staining (Figure 3A-B and supplemental Figure 5A-D).
These results suggest the existence of a paracrine circuit, where activatedCLLcellsproduceeNAMPT,thatinturnrecruitsmonocytes through CCL3 secretion59 and induces macrophage differentiation. The use of puriﬁed monocyte preparations conﬁrmed that eNAMPT acts directly on this cell population (supplemental Figure 5E).

The monocyte subset of CLL patients showed constitutive M2 skewing, based on high interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) transcription factor and low IL-12 levels, considered M2 and M1 markers, respectively (supplemental Figure 6A). Surface expression of the scavenger receptor CD163 and of the mannose receptor CD206, considered M2 markers, strengthened this ﬁnding (supple- mental Figure 6B).60,61 Treatment of puriﬁed CLL monocytes with rNAMPT further enhanced M2 features, as inferred on the basis of (1)atranscriptionalproﬁle,whichshowedinductionofCCL18,IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL3 genes (Figure 3C); (2) evidence of increased concentrations of the same cytokines/chemokines in the super- natants of rNAMPT-treated monocytes (Figure 3D); and (3)

increased expression of CD163 and CD206 (Figure 3E-G). Similar effects following rNAMPT treatment were observed when using monocytes from HDs (supplemental Figure 7A-B), suggesting that both HD and CLL monocytes can respond to rNAMPT.
NLCs express high levels of NAMPT
Monocytes from CLL patients spontaneously differentiate in vitro into NLCs, large, multinucleated, adherent cells that protect the leukemic clone from apoptosis.14,16 NLCs are also present in lymphoid tissues where they presumably deliver prosurvival signals to CLL cells.62 In agreement with evidence suggesting that NLCs

are closely related to tumor-associated macrophages,11,12,43 they expressed high levels of IRF4 and of the tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO; Figure 4A). Their chemokine/cytokine proﬁle was typical of M2 macrophages, includ- ing IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, CCL18, CCL22, and CCL3. PD-L1, the ligand for the inhibitory programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor, was also highly expressed. Conversely, IL-12 mRNA, which distinguishes M1 macrophages, was undetectable (Figure 4A), as was expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80 (supplemental Figure 8A).
In NLC samples, NAMPT mRNA was invariably elevated (Figure 4A-B). Moreover, conditioned media from NLC cultures contained high amounts of eNAMPT (Figure 4C). Differentiation of NLCs from CLL PBMC preparations was signiﬁcantly increased when rNAMPT was added to the cultures during the differentiation process (Figure 4D). This conclusion was based on (1) morphologic parameters (Figure 4E)and(2)expressionoflineage-speciﬁcmarkers such as CD11b and CD68 (supplemental Figure 8B-D), suggesting that NAMPT is important for full NLC differentiation. Conﬁrmation was obtained by deriving NLCs in the presence of a blocking anti- NAMPT goat pAb,33 which signiﬁcantly decreased the total number ofdifferentiatedcells(Figure4D-E).Furthermore,treatmentwiththe immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, which partially corrects the
M2 phenotype,63 robustly decreased NAMPT mRNA levels and in eNAMPT concentrations in spent media (Figure 4B-C), in- dicating that NAMPT is part of the M2 signature. As expected, IRF4 expression was signiﬁcantly downregulated (supplemental Figure 8E).64

Furthermore, exposure of NLCs to rNAMPT for 24 hours was followed by enhanced transcription of IRF4, IDO, CCL18, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL3 (Figure 5E-F), the same transcripts that were previously found in rNAMPT-treated mono- cytes(Figure3C-D).Thecorrespondingcytokinesandchemokines

differentiated NLCs as well.

rNAMPT enhances the immunosuppressive features of NLCs
rNAMPT-treated NLCs were characterized by increased expression of the M2 macrophage markers CD163 (Figure 6A) and CD206 (Figure6B).Theywerealsocharacterizedbyincreasedphagocytosis of FITC-conjugated dextran particles (Figure 6C), which was how- ever independent of CD206, as inferred by using a neutralizing anti- CD206 antibody (supplemental Figure 11).39
NLC generated in the presence of rNAMPT had a greater ability to sustain leukemic cells (Figure 6D). Conversely, when autologous T lymphocytes preactivated using anti-CD3 antibody and IL-2 were cultured with NLCs in the presence of rNAMPT, proliferation was markedly suppressed (Figure 6E). These culture conditions also increasedthenumberofregulatoryTcells(Treg’s),asdeterminedon the basis of a CD41/CD25high/CD127low phenotype (Figure 6F). Lastly, culture of T cells in the presence of rNAMPT-treated NLCs led to the upmodulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis (Figure 6G-H).66 UpontotalPBMCscoculturingwithautologousNLCsinthepresence of rNAMPT, CD41 T lymphocytes showed higher PD-1 expression thanwhenthesamecellswereculturedwithNLCswithoutrNAMPT (Figure6G).Consistently,inthepresenceofrNAMPT,NLCsexpressed higher levels of PD-L1 (Figure 6H).
Together, these ﬁndings suggest that eNAMPT is among the soluble factors produced by leukemic cells to turn nonneoplastic bystander cells into supporters of tumor growth and survival.
eNAMPT effects are independent of the enzymatic functions of the molecule
To explore the role of enzymatic activity in modulating eNAMPT effects, we selected STAT3 activation and NLC differentiation as prototypes of short- and long-term rNAMPT effects. Four lines of evidence argue in favor of a nonenzymatic function of eNAMPT in this model. First, exposure of NLCs to extracellular NMN failed to induce STAT3 phosphorylation, suggesting that the product of the reaction is inactive (Figure 7A-C). Second, treatment of NLCs with rNAMPT diluted in PBS, without medium that contains high levels of nicotinamide, the substrate of the reaction, induced prominent activation of STAT3(Figure 7D).Third, treatment withthe NAMPT inhibitorFK866didnotblocktheabilityofrNAMPTtostimulatethe phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figure 7E). Fourth, the enzymatically inactive NAMPT H247E mutant67 retained the ability to activate STAT3 phosphorylation (Figure 7F-G).22 Considered together, these results indicate that the enzymatic activity of eNAMPT is dispens- able when triggering NLC activation. Similarly, the H247E mutant enhanced NLC differentiation, as determined by morphologic pa- rameters and proteinexpression (CD11b and CD68; Figure 7H-J and supplemental Figure 12A-B).
Overall these results indicate that the enzymatic activity of eNAMPT is not essential for activating signaling or inducing long- term effects such as NLC differentiation.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that NAMPT possesses 2 distinct functions intheCLLmicroenvironment.Insidethecell,itregulatesproduction of NMN from nicotinamide, the limiting step in the generation of NAD. CLL lymphocytes expressed higher levels of iNAMPT and contained higher amounts of NMN and of NAD than circulating normalBlymphocytesfromdonorsofsimilarages,aﬁndingconsistent with increased NAD needs to allow for continued glycolytic ﬂux.68
ROLE OF NAMPT IN THE CLL MICROENVIRONMENT
Consistently, iNAMPT levels were further upregulated when CLL cells were activated through distinct receptors, suggesting also that NAMPT transcription may be controlled by signaling intermediates commontothesepathways,includingBTK.Thesigniﬁcantdifference in NAD levels between CLL cells and normal B lymphocytes was also noted in a previous study using a different method.69 These data are also in line with reports indicating that CLL lymphocytes are particularly sensitive to the NAMPT inhibitor FK866, which induces rapid NAD deprivation.70-72
The second main ﬁnding of this work is that elevated amounts of eNAMPT are present in the plasma of CLL patients. In the CLL samples examined, eNAMPT levels were signiﬁcantly higher than those scored by controls, which were in line with the literature.58 Aftercorrectingforthenumberofcirculatingmonocytes,weobserved a direct correlation between eNAMPT levels and lymphocytosis, indirectly suggesting that the leukemic cells contribute to eNAMPT production. In agreement with this hypothesis, activation of puriﬁed CLL lymphocytes increased the concentrations of eNAMPT, and within LN proliferating CLL cells were clearly NAMPT1.
eNAMPT produced by CLL cells enhanced polarization of cir- culating monocytes into macrophages with an M2 phenotype. This conclusion was reached after showing (1) expression of nuclear factorsandsurfacemarkersinvolvedinM2differentiation,(2)secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines, and (3) production of mediatorsofimmunesuppression.Theuseofablockinganti-NAMPT antibody signiﬁcantly compromised NLC differentiation and pheno- type, arguing for a direct role of the molecule in the acquisition of M2 properties.
NAMPT is also part of the M2 signature, as inferred from the ﬁnding that both monocytes and NLCs contained high levels of iNAMPT and could produce eNAMPT. Consistently, the use of lenalidomide to correct M2 polarization of NLCs was followed by a marked decrease of iNAMPT and eNAMPT.
When NLCs were exposed to NAMPT ERK1/2, STAT3 and NF-kBwere activated, arguing for a direct effect of this protein on the target cells. The blocking anti-NAMPT antibody completely abrogated pathway activation, in line with a receptor-mediated effect. Culture with rNAMPT also enhanced the immunosuppressive phenotype of NLCs, as well as their ability to sustain CLL survival and suppress autologous T-cell proliferation and Treg expansion. This could be achieved through the production of IL-6 and IL-8 as tumor-promoting cytokines,73,74 while IL-10, CCL18, and IDO could act as immunosuppressors.75
Oneoftheintriguingquestionsintheﬁeldconcernstheroleofthe enzymatic activity in the functions exerted by eNAMPT. Our data indicatedthateNAMPTiscatalyticallyactive,asexpected,76,77even ifNMN,thereactionproduct,wasundetectablebothinplasmaandin media, conﬁrming previous data.78 This ﬁnding, together with the observationthateNAMPTmightbeunabletocatalyzeNMNformation in the extracellular space because of the lack of suitable substrate concentrations (particularly PRPP),53 suggests that the functional responses elicited by eNAMPT are independent of its catalytic activity. Four independent lines of evidence, including the use of inactive eNAMPT mutant (H247E),67 are provided to support the conclusion that NAMPT activity is dispensable to activate STAT3 and NF-kB pathways in NLCs and long-term NLC differentiation. This ﬁnding leaves open the issue of how eNAMPT may exert its functional activities.Futurestudieswill tellwhetherthereisaNAMPTreceptor or whether alternative mechanisms, such as internalization of the enzyme, are in place.
From the translational point of view, an important observation is that drugs interfering with CLL signaling, such as ibrutinib, can
