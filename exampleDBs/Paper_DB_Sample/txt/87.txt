Sirtuins comprise a family of enzymes found in all organisms, where they play a role in diverse processes including transcrip- tional silencing, aging, regulation of transcription, and metabo- lism. The predominant reaction catalyzed by these enzymes is NAD(cid:1)-dependent lysine deacetylation, although some sirtuins exhibit a weaker ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Although the Sir2 deacetylation mechanism is well established, much less is knownabouttheSir2ADP-ribosylationreaction.Wehavestud- ied the ADP-ribosylation activity of a bacterial sirtuin, Sir2Tm, and show that acetylated peptides containing arginine or lysine 2 residues C-terminal to the acetyl lysine, the (cid:1)2 position, are preferentially ADP-ribosylated at the (cid:1)2 residue. A structure of Sir2Tm bound to the acetylated (cid:1)2 arginine peptide shows how this arginine could enter the active site and react with a deacetylation reaction intermediate to yield an ADP-ribosy- lated peptide. The new biochemical and structural studies presented here provide mechanistic insights into the Sir2 ADP-ribosylation reaction and will aid in identifying sub- strates of this reaction.
Sirtuins, also known as Sir2 enzymes, are a universally con- servedclassofNAD(cid:1)-dependentacetyl-lysinespecificdeacety- lases (1). Sir2 deacetylation substrates include histones (2), FoxO transcription factors (3, 4), p53 (5), and PGC-1(cid:1)(6, 7). Sir2 enzymes regulate multiple biological pathways including gene silencing (8, 9), transcription (3, 4), and fat metabolism (10).
The sirtuin deacetylation reaction consumes acetyl lysine and NAD(cid:1), yielding deacetylated lysine, nicotinamide, and O-acetyl ADP-ribose (11). In the first step of the enzymatic reaction, the acetyl lysine reacts with the C1(cid:2) of the NAD(cid:1) nicotinamide-ribose,leadingtothereleaseofnicotinamideand formationofanO-alkylamidateintermediate(11,12).Next,the nicotinamide-ribose 2(cid:2)OH reacts with the O-alkylamidate intermediate to generate a 1(cid:2)2(cid:2)-bicyclic species and the deacetylated lysine (11). Finally, hydrolysis of the 1(cid:2)2(cid:2)-bicyclic species yields 2(cid:2) O-acetyl ADP-ribose (11, 13). The Sir2 deacetylation reaction is inhibited by the reaction product, nic-
otinamide(14, 15), which binds to the Sir2 active site and reacts with the O-alkylamidate to regenerate NAD(cid:1) and acetyl lysine. Alhough Sir2 enzymes are known primarily as protein deacetylases, sirtuins were first identified as NAD(cid:1)-depend- ent ADP-ribosyltransferases (16). The Escherichia coli sir- tuin, CobB, ribosylates a small molecule, 5,6-dimethylben- zimidazole (17, 18). Subsequent studies demonstrated that CobB can also ADP-ribosylate protein substrates (18). Other sirtuins including human SIRT1(19), human SIRT4 (20), and a trypanosomal sirtuin (21) can ADP-ribosylate protein sub- strates. The Trypanosoma brucei Sir2 enzyme, TbSir2Rp1, is a particularly well characterized sirtuin with ADP-ribosyltrans- ferase activity. TbSir2Rp1 has dual deacetylase and ADP-ribo- syltransferase activities on histone substrates (21); however, its deacetylation activity is 5 orders of magnitude greater than its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (22). The TbSir2Rp1 ribosyla- tionactivityisgreatlyenhancedbyacetyllysine(22).Onemodel that could explain the increased Sir2 ADP-ribosyltransferase activity with acetylated substrates is that a deacetylation reac- tion intermediate, possibly the O-alkylamidate intermediate, reacts with a nucleophilic amino acid on the substrate protein to yield an ADP-ribosylated product (22). How a nucleophilic side chain enters the Sir2 active site or what amino acid side chains can be ADP-ribosylated by sirtuins is not known.
In structures of sirtuins bound to an acetylated p53 peptide and to an S-alkylamidate intermediate (23–27), a methionine located two residues C-terminal to the acetyl lysine, the (cid:1)2 position, inserts into the Sir2 active site (see Fig. 1A). This sug- gested that substrates containing nucleophilic side chains at this position could potentially attack the O-alkylamidate inter- mediate and become ADP-ribosylated. To test this model, we performed a series of biochemical assays on the Thermotoga maritima sirtuin, Sir2Tm, and the mammalian sirtuin, SIRT1, using various peptides and found that these sirtuins ADP-ribo- sylate arginine at the (cid:1)2 position in an acetylated peptide sub- strate. To gain further mechanistic insights, we solved a struc- ture of Sir2Tm bound to the Arg-acetylated (cid:1)2 peptide.

The sequences of the peptides are KKGQSTSRHK(KAC)LXFKTEG, where X is Met, Lys, Arg, or Glu. The reaction buffer used in all experiments consisted of 50 mM CHES,2 pH (cid:3) 9.2, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothrei- tol. To resolve the radiolabeled peptides, the reaction mixtures wereseparatedbyelectrophoresisonNuPAGE4–12%Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), and unincorporated [32P]NAD(cid:1) was washed out by soaking the gels in destaining solution (10% acetic acid and 5% ethanol). Gels were dried and exposed to film, and the amount of radiolabel transferred to the peptide was quantified by densitometry with the ImageJ software package.

Edman Degradation of the Acetyl p53 (cid:1)2 Peptide—Sir2Tm, at a concentration of 100 (cid:2)M, was incubated with 1 mM (cid:1)2 Arg-acetylated p53 peptide, with the sequence KKGQSTSRH- K(KAC)LRFKTEG, and 10 (cid:2)Ci of [32P]NAD(cid:1) in a final reaction volume of 50 (cid:2)l for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel. The p53 peptide band was cut out of the gel and homogenized. The peptide was extracted by incubating the gel slice in 500 (cid:2)l of 100 mM sodium acetate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 10 h followed by centrifugation to pellet the gel pieces. The pep- tide was then extracted from the supernatant by acetone precipitation.
Manual Edman degradation was performed on the peptide sampletoidentifytheADP-ribosylatedresidue.Briefly,20(cid:2)lof 5%(v/v)solutionofphenylisothiocyanateinpyridinewasadded to the peptide sample and incubated for 30 min at 45 °C fol- lowed by the addition of 200 (cid:2)l of a 10:1 (v/v) heptane-ethyl acetatesolution.Theupperorganiclayerwascollected,andthe aqueousphasewasextractedwitha2:1(v/v)heptane-ethylace- tatesolution.TheaqueousphasewaslyophilizedinaSpeedVac evaporatorandthenresuspendedin50(cid:2)lof100%trifluoroace- tic acid and incubated for 10 min at 45 °C. Then, 50 (cid:2)l of pyri- dine and 250 (cid:2)l of butyl acetate were added, and the butyl ace- tate layer was collected because the N-terminal thiazolinone amino acid partitions into the butyl acetate. The butyl acetate fractionwaslyophilizedandresuspendedin20(cid:2)lofwater.This reaction cycle was repeated 19 times. The collected thiazolin- one amino acids from each cycle were added to 5 ml of scintil- lation fluid, and the radioactivity was quantified with a scintil- lation counter.
Peptide Binding Assays—Sir2Tm (0.4 (cid:2)M) was incubated with various peptide concentrations, and the changes in intrin- sic tyrosine fluorescence (excitation wave length of 280 nm) due to binding of Sir2Tm to peptide were measured on an ISS Chronos fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer. The p53 2 (cid:1) Glu, Met, and Lys peptide binding quenched the tyrosine fluorescence of Sir2Tm, whereas binding of the p53 (cid:1)2 Arg peptide enhanced the fluorescence signal. Binding curves were fit with equation 1

RESULTS
The Amino Acid Two Positions C-terminal to the Acetyl Lysine Affects Ribosylation of Substrate Peptides—We wished to test the hypothesis that a side chain in the peptide sub- strate could react with a Sir2 deacetylation reaction interme- diate, likely the O-alkylamidate intermediate, and become ADP-ribosylated. One intriguing proposal for Sir2-mediated ribosylation is that a nucleophile on the acetylated protein substrate could insert into the Sir2 active site and react with the O-alkylamidate to yield ADP-ribosylated substrate (22). In all structures of Sir2Tm bound to an acetylated p53 pep- tide, there is a methionine two residues C-terminal to the acetyl lysine (the (cid:1)2 position) that inserts into the Sir2 active site through an opening adjacent to the acetyl lysine binding tunnel (Fig. 1A). In the structure of Sir2Tm bound to an S-al- kylamidate intermediate, the (cid:1)2 methionine points at the C1(cid:2) of the S-alkylamidate and is 7 Å away from the C1(cid:2) (Fig. 1A) (23), raising the possibility that a side chain nucleophile at the (cid:1)2 position could react with the O-alkylamidate interme- diate and become ADP-ribosylated. Although the (cid:1)2 methio- nine is not expected to react with a reaction intermediate,

nucleophilic amino acids would have a higher probability of attacking a Sir2 reaction intermediate.
To determine whether Sir2Tm could ADP-ribosylate a side chain nucleophile at the (cid:1)2 position, we synthesized a series of peptides containing different amino acids at the (cid:1)2 position and assayed Sir2Tm ADP-ribosylation activity for these peptides (Fig. 1B). The sequence of the peptides was based on the acetylated p53 peptide previously crystallized
with Sir2Tm (25). The sequence of the peptides assayed was KKGQSTSRHK(KAC)LXFKTEG, where X was Met, Lys, Arg, or Glu (Fig. 1B). Sir2Tm, which has robust deacetylation activity, was incubated with the acetylated peptides and [32P]NAD(cid:1) (Fig. 1B). As seen by autoradiography (Fig. 1, B and C) and also confirmed by mass spectrometry (supple- mental data), acetylated peptides with arginine and lysine substitutions at the (cid:1)2 position had a 5- and 4-fold increase,

respectively, in incorporated 32P radiolabel as compared with the methionine-containing peptide, presumably due to ADP-ribosylation. The acetylated peptide with a glutamic acid substitution had only a 2-fold increase in labeling rela- tive to the wild type peptide (Fig. 1, B and C).
To determine whether the ADP-ribosylation of the acety- lated peptide was the result of Sir2Tm enzymatic activity, and not a nonenzymatic reaction with [32P]NAD(cid:1), Sir2Tm was reacted with 1 mM NAD(cid:1) at various concentrations of the acetylated (cid:1)2 Arg peptide. At high peptide concentrations, the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is saturated, suggesting that the observed labeling is enzymatic. The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 1D), which showed that the Km for the Sir2Tm ribosylation reaction is 350 (cid:2)M as compared with a Km of 150 (cid:2)M for the deacetylation reaction. These observations are consistent with two models; either the argi- nineorlysinetwoaminoacidsC-terminaltotheacetyllysinein the acetylated p53 substrate is ADP-ribosylated by Sir2Tm, or the lysine and arginine promote ADP-ribosylation of another residue in the p53 peptide.
TodeterminewhetherothersirtuinssharethesameADP-ri- bosylation activity as Sir2Tm, mouse SIRT1 was assayed using the p53 peptide variants described in Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 1E, SIRT1 ADP-ribosylation activity is 4-fold higher for the (cid:1)2 arginine peptide than for the (cid:1)2 methionine peptide. The acetylated peptides with lysine and glutamic acid substitutions at the (cid:1)2 position only exhibited a 2.5- and 2-fold increase in labeling, respectively, as compared with the acetylated peptide containing methionine at that position (Fig. 1E). The increase in ADP-ribosylation activity for both a mammalian and a bac- terialsirtuinwithanacetylatedp53peptidecontainingarginine at the (cid:1)2 position demonstrates that ADP-ribosylation activity is conserved in at least a subset of sirtuins.

To determine whether the increased ADP-ribosylation of the arginine-substituted pep- tide was dependent on the precise position of the substituted argi- nine within the acetylated peptide, the ADP-ribosylation of peptides with arginine substituted at differ- ent positions was compared. As shown in Fig. 2, peptides with argi- nine at positions (cid:1)3 and (cid:1)4 showed negligible labeling as com- pared with the acetylated (cid:1)2 argi- nine peptide. The peptides with arginine substituted at other posi- tions have the same amount of background ADP-ribosylation as both acetylated and unacetylated peptide (Fig. 2). This demon- strates that the position of the arginine two residues C-terminal to the acetyl lysine is important for the ribosylation reaction to occur and that it is not simply the pres- ence of arginine in the peptide that gives rise to the increased labeling.

The unacetylated (cid:1)2 arginine peptide was not significantly lysine enhances indicating that acetyl ADP-ribosylated, Sir2Tm ribosylation activity (Fig. 2) and supporting the pre- vious observation that acetyl lysine is necessary for signifi- cant ADP-ribosylation (22).
Sir2TmDirectlyRibosylatesthe(cid:1)2ArginineoftheAcetylp53 Peptide—To determine which amino acid in the (cid:1)2 Arg pep- tide (Fig. 1B) is ADP-ribosylated by Sir2Tm, we performed manual Edman degradation on the acetylated p53 (cid:1)2 arginine peptide that had been incubated with Sir2Tm and [32P]NAD(cid:1). IneachcycleofEdmandegradation,theN-terminalaminoacid is isolated. Because the NAD(cid:1) is radiolabeled and the sequence of the peptide is known, ADP-ribosylated residues were identi- fied by relating the radioactivity in each cycle number to the primary sequence of the acetyl p53 peptide. Cycle number 13 contained a significant amount of radiolabel, indicating that the (cid:1)2 arginine is ADP-ribosylated by Sir2Tm (Fig. 3). This is the arginine that was substituted for methionine in the wild type p53 peptide and resulted in increased Sir2Tm ri- bosylation (Fig. 1, B and C). Radiolabel was also present in cycle number 2, indicating that an N-terminal lysine was also ADP-ribosylated by Sir2Tm (Fig. 3).
Sir2Tm Peptide Binding Affinity and Ribosylation Activity Are Not Correlated—To determine whether the different levels of ADP-ribosylation activity for the acetylated (cid:1)2 arginine and (cid:1)2 lysine peptides were due to different binding affinities of Sir2Tm for these peptides, we measured the Kd values for Sir2Tm binding to acetylated peptides containing different amino acid substitutions at the (cid:1)2 position. To measure Kd values, we developed a fluorescence-based binding assay that uses the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of Sir2Tm. The binding isotherms were fit to determine the Kd of the Sir2Tm-acety- lated p53 peptide interaction (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sir2Tm binds more tightly to the (cid:1)2 methionine (Kd of 2.7 (cid:2)M) and (cid:1)2 glutamic acid (Kd of 0.11 (cid:2)M) peptides, as compared with the (cid:1)2 lysine (Kd of 27.8 (cid:2)M) and (cid:1)2 arginine (Kd of 28.2 (cid:2)M) peptides. Interestingly, Sir2Tm has the highest ADP-ribo- sylation activity for the acetylated p53 arginine and lysine pep- tides, yet Sir2Tm binds to these peptides with the lowest affin- ities. Conversely, the methionine and glutamic acid peptides showthelowestleveloflabelingbySir2Tm,yetSir2Tmbindsto these peptides with the highest affinity. Given the lack of cor- relation between binding affinity and ADP-ribosylation of the acetylated peptides, the differences in ADP-ribosylation activ- ity with different peptide substrates cannot be ascribed to dif- ferences in binding affinity.

Crystal Structure of a Sir2Tm-p53 Arginine Peptide Complex— To explore how Sir2Tm uses the (cid:1)2 arginine peptide as an ADP-ribosylation substrate, we determined the crystal struc- ture of a Sir2Tm bound to acetylated p53 peptide containing arginine at the (cid:1)2 position to 1.5 Å resolution (PDB code 3JR3 and Fig. 4A). The binding of the acetyl lysine residue in the active site is identical to that observed in previous structures of sirtuins bound to acetylated peptides (Fig. 4A). The arginine two amino acids C-terminal to the acetyl lysine enters the Sir2 active site through a cleft that lies adjacent to the acetyl lysine bindingtunnel(Fig.4,AandB).The(cid:1)2arginineformsahydro- gen bond with Asp-49 of Sir2Tm (3.2 Å) and stacks against
Becauseithasbeenproposedthatasidechainnucleophileon a protein substrate could likely react with the O-alkylamidate to generate an ADP-ribosylated protein (22), we examined whether the (cid:1)2 arginine was in a position to react with the C1(cid:2) inacomplexwiththeO-alkylamidateintermediate.However,a superposition of the present structure with that of the Sir2Tm- S-alkylamidatestructureshowsthatthepositionofthe(cid:1)2argi- nine would place the guanidino nitrogen 6.7 Å away from the C1(cid:2) carbon of the S-alkylamidate, which appears too far for the (cid:1)2 Arg to react with the O-alkylamidate intermediate (Fig. 4C). Because of the long distance between the arginine and S-alkylamidate, either the arginine or the imidate intermediate

would have to move for ADP-ribosylation of arginine to occur. In the crystal structure, the arginine is not fully extended (Fig. 4A). However, by rotating the bonds in the arginine side chain, the arginine can be repositioned within van der Waals contact
distance (3.6 Å) of the C1(cid:2) of the S-alkylamidate (Fig. 5). This suggests that it is possible for the arginine to move farther into the Sir2 active site and contact the imidate intermediate. It is possible that the addition of NAD(cid:1) and formation of the O-alkylamidate would promote the (cid:1)2 arginine to adopt a more extended conformation that could react with the O-al- kylamidate intermediate to yield the ADP-ribosylated product.
DISCUSSION
FIGURE5.ModelofaSir2Tmacetylp53Arg-S-alkylamidatecomplex.The Sir2Tm S-alklyl amidate-p53 (cid:1)2 Arg ((cid:1)2R) peptide complex was modeled to determine whether the arginine could approach the intermediate.
The work presented here provides mechanistic insights into how acetylated substrates exhibit enhanced ADP-ribo- sylation by Sir2Tm. In several structures of either Sir2Tm or Sir2Af2 bound to an acetylated p53 peptide, the peptide methionine located two amino acids C-terminal to the acetyl lysine inserts into the enzyme active site just adjacent to the acetyl lysine (23–26). Previously, Kowieski et al. (22) pro- posed that a nucleophilic side chain on an acetylated protein substratecouldinterceptaSir2deacetylationreactioninterme- diate.ThisproposalandpreviousSir2-acetylatedpeptidestruc- tures led us to speculate that a nucleophilic amino acid substituted at the (cid:1)2 position could react with the O-alkylamidate intermediate to yield an ADP-ribosylated product. Basedonthedimensionsandgeom- etry of the Sir2Tm active site (26), the (cid:1)2 amino acid from the sub- strate peptide needs to be longer than 5 Å to enter the active site, and ideally, longer than 6 Å. We found that substituting lysine or arginine at this key position of the acetylated p53 peptide indeed results in in- creased enzymatic ADP-ribosyla- tionbySir2Tm(Figs.1,BandD,and 2). The acetyl p53 (cid:1)2 Arg peptide also stimulates ADP-ribosylation activity of SIRT1 (Fig. 1E), suggest- ing that ADP-ribosylation activity is conserved in at least a subset of Sir2 enzymes. Peptides with arginine substitutionsatpositionsotherthan two amino acids C-terminal to the acetyl lysine are far less efficiently ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 2), indicating that ADP-ribosylation by Sir2Tm is sensitive to the position of the sub- stituted arginine. Acetyl lysine resi- dues that are substrates for Sir2 enzymes are located in loop regions of proteins, so using peptide sub- strates is reasonable. However, it would be informative to analyze the Sir2 ribosylation activity on a pro- tein substrate.

Next, the (cid:1)2 arginine would react with the O-alkyl- amidate to generate ADP-ribosylated arginine, nicotinamide, and acetyl lysine (Fig. 6, step II).
The significance of the ADP-ribosylation activity of sirtuins to their physiological function remains an open question. The best established role for this activity is the regulation of the mitochondrial enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase, by SIRT4 (20). Glutamate dehydrogenase had previously been shown to be inactivated by ADP-ribosylation, and SIRT4 was subse- quently identified as the enzyme responsible for the ADP-ribo- sylation (20). Although it is not known whether ADP-ribosyla- tion of glutamate dehydrogenase is dependent upon prior acetylationofthatenzyme,itwasrecentlyfoundthatglutamate dehydrogenase is acetylated at multiple sites (34), raising the possibility that ADP-ribosylation of this enzyme could proceed as described here for Sir2Tm. Although other mono-ADP-ri- bosylated proteins have been identified in eukaryotic cells (35), it remains to be determined which enzymes are responsible for adding this post-translational modification in vivo.

An N-terminal lysine is also ADP-ribosylated in the acety- lated(cid:1)2Argpeptide,suggestinganalternatepathwayforADP- ribosylating substrates (Fig. 3). In structures of Sir2Tm bound to the acetylated p53 peptide, this N-terminal lysine cannot access the Sir2Tm active site. The N-terminal lysine is disor- dered in all of the Sir2Tm-acetyl p53 peptide complex struc- turesandextendsoutintosolvent.Thereareatleastthreemod- els that could explain the ADP-ribosylation of this lysine. First, the reaction product O-acetyl ADP-ribose or NAD(cid:1) could react with this lysine nonenzymatically to yield a ribosylated product. There are three additional lysines in the acetyl p53 peptide that are not ribosylated (Fig. 2), arguing that this non- enzymatic mechanism is not likely. A second model would involve binding of a first acetyl peptide and formation of the O-alkylamidateintermediate.Next,anotherpeptidecouldbind toSir2TmandinserttheN-terminallysineintotheactivesiteto reactwiththeO-alkylamidateintermediateoranotherdeacety- lation intermediate. Based on all identified entry tunnels to the Sir2activesite,thelysinefromthesecondpeptidewouldnotbe longenoughtogainaccesstotheactivesite,suggestingthatthis mechanism is not likely. A third model involves Sir2Tm bind- ingtheN-terminallysinethroughtheacetyllysinebindingtun- nel instead of the acetyl lysine. A crystal structure of Sir2Tm bound to an unacetylated p53 peptide demonstrates that Sir2Tm can bind unacetylated lysine peptides within the acetyl lysine binding tunnel (24). The unacetylated lysine can insert into the active site and come within 4.5 Å of the C1(cid:2) of NAD(cid:1) (Fig. 7). Next, the lysine could then directly attack the C1(cid:2) of NAD(cid:1) to yield a ribosylated lysine and nicotinamide. Fur- ther studies will be required to assess this proposed mecha- nism and determine whether other post-translational modifi- cations including propionyl-lysine, which is a substrate for Sir2Tm-mediated depropionylation(33), are substrates for the Sir2 ribosylation reaction.
