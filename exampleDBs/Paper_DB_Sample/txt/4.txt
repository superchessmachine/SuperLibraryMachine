A New DUB Makes Linear Ubiquitin a Party to Its Own Destruction

Linear ubiquitin (Ub) plays a role in nuclear factor kB signaling, but the deubiquitinating enzyme that disassembles these chains was unknown. In this issue of Cell, Keusekotten et al. identify a new enzyme that disassembles linear chains with the use of a mechanism that relies on Ub itself to help catalyze peptide bond cleavage.
Ubiquitination plays a remarkable range of signaling roles in diverse cellular pro- cesses, including protein degradation, the DNA damage response, kinase acti- vation, and the inﬂammatory response (Komander and Rape, 2012). The ubiqui- tin (Ub) modiﬁcation can consist of a sin- gle Ub protein (monoubiquitination) or one of a variety of polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains, each signaling a distinct outcome. The Ub C terminus is covalently linked to substrate lysines in the E1-E2-E3 enzyme cascade, yielding anisopeptide bond with the epsilon amine of lysine. Ub itself can be ubiquitinated at any of its seven types of resulting in different lysines, polyUb chains. Adding to this complexity was the discovery of Met1-linked linear polyUb chains that are assembled by peptide bond formation between the C terminus of one Ub and the N terminus
of the next (reviewed in Rieser et al., 2013). The most well-characterized role of linear Ub is in TNFa signaling, where these polyUb chains are instrumental in activating the inhibitor of kB kinase (IKK) complex and, ultimately, lead to the trans- factor kB (NF-kB) location of nuclear to the nucleus (Tokunaga et al., 2009). A key question in studies of linear polyUb signaling is how this unique chain type is assembled and degraded. Only one E3 ligase complex, linear Ub chain assembly complex (LUBAC), is known to assemble linear Ub (Kirisako et al., 2006), whereas the identity of the deubiquitinating enzyme that speciﬁcally cleaves linear Ub remained unknown. In this issue of Cell, Keusekotten et al. identify a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that they name OTULIN (ovarian tumor [OTU] linkage speciﬁcity) DUB with linear

that cleaves linear Ub and antagonizes LUBAC, thereby regulating NF-kB sig- naling (Figure 1A).
Although upwards of 90 DUBs have been identiﬁed in the human genome (Komander et al., 2009), the enzyme that to be a cleaves linear Ub turned out previously unannotated protein called Fam105b. Keusekotten et al. (2013) used a bioinformatics screen to identify Fam105b as a putative member of the OTU family of DUBs with an intact cata- lytic triad of Cys, His and Asn. However, in contrast to the 14 known OTU family members, they found that FAM105b/ OTULIN is unable to cleave isopeptide linkages. Instead, OTULIN is a peptidase that exclusively cleaves Met1-linear Ub. A particular surprise is that OTULIN does not cleave Lys63-linked polyUb, despite the similarity between linear and

Figure 1. OTULIN Acts as the DUB for Linear Ubiquitin Chains (A) The E3ligase complex LUBAC assembleslinear Ub by forming peptide bonds between the N and C termini of successive Ub monomers. These peptide bonds are cleaved by OTULIN, which disassembles linear polyUb chains and releases monomeric Ub. (B) OTULIN binds to diUb, positioning the peptide bond that joins Met1 of the proximal Ub with the C-terminal Gly76 of the distal Ub in the OTULIN active site. Glu16 (E16) of the proximal Ub inserts into the active site and helps to position the catalytic triad for catalysis. (C) OTULIN antagonizes LUBAC signaling. Linear Ub chains are involved in TNFa signaling, down- stream activation of MAPK, and the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus.

High-resolution crystal structures of OTULINwith andwithout aboundlinear diubiquitin (diUb) substrate (Keusekotten et al., 2013) show OTULIN to be remark- ably similar in fold to OTUB1, another OTU DUB that speciﬁcally cleaves K48- linked polyUb. Like OTUB1 (Juang et al., 2012; Wiener et al., 2012), OTULIN contains distinct binding sites for the proximal and distal Ubs (Figure 1B). Given these similarities, how is it that OTULIN

is so speciﬁc for the Met1 peptide bond and, yet, unable to cleave other types of polyUb chains containing isopeptide linkages?
It turns out that OTULIN not only favors binding to peptide-linked linear Ub but also relies upon the Ub substrate to be a party to its own destruction. The OTULIN-binding uniquely sites tailored to accommodate linear Ub, which binds 100-fold more tightly to OTU- LIN than even structurally similar K63- linked chains. OTULIN orients the linear diUb substrate with the amino terminus of the proximal Ub (Figure 1B) in the active site and prevents access by other Ub ly- sines, further enforcing speciﬁcity for linear Ub. Importantly, this orientation en- ables Glu16 of the proximal Ub to contribute directly to enzyme catalysis by positioning residues in the catalytic triad in a catalytically competent state, a mechanism known as substrate-assisted catalysis. The reliance of OTULIN on both selective binding to linear chains and is exploited to ensure that OTULIN disas- sembles only linear Ub, whose abun- dance in the cell is low in relation to iso- peptide-linked polyUb chains. This is the ﬁrst example of a deubiquitinating enzyme that relies upon substrate- assisted catalysis. Given that the present study marks only the second structure of a DUB bound to a true substrate, it will be interesting to see whether substrate- assisted catalysis is used by other DUBs to ensure substrate speciﬁcity or whether deubiquitinating enzyme activators may also exploit this mechanism for their func- tion.

OTULIN antagonizes linear Ub sig- naling in the cell (Figure 1C), consistent with a role in disassembling this unique chain type. Although the cellular roles of linear Ub are still under active study, its role has been best characterized in NF-kB signaling. Expression of LUBAC, the multisubunit E3 ligase that assembles Met1-linked polyUb chains, induces NF-kB signaling (Tokunaga et al., 2009). Accordingly, the expression of wild-type OTULIN, but not a catalytic mutant, decreases levels of linear Ub. However, the expression of catalytically inactive OTULIN also inhibits NF-kB signaling, suggesting an additional noncatalytic role for OTULIN. Keusekotten et al.
(2013) suggest that catalytically inactive OTULIN serves as a trap for linear Ub linear and thereby Ub-binding proteins required for NF-kB signaling. Whether the effect of catalyti- cally inactive OTULIN reﬂects an addi- tional noncatalytic role in regulating Met1-Ub chain assembly, analogous to the ability of the related OTUB1 enzyme to inhibit K63-linked polyubiquitination by binding to E2 Ub-conjugating en- zymes, remains an open question (Na- kada et al., 2010; Wiener et al., 2012).
competes with
Many deubiquitinating enzymes have been found in complex with Ub E3 ligases (Sowa et al., 2009), an unexpected ﬁnd- ing given their opposing activities. This feature is apparently shared by OTULIN, which can be coprecipitated with LUBAC (Keusekotten et al., 2013). The beneﬁt of coupling chain assembly and disas- sembly is still not known, but it suggests crosstalk between these two classes of enzymes. OTULIN removes linear Ub from LUBAC, leaving open the possibility that this may provide a mechanism for regulating E3 activity. Whether this is, indeed, important for LUBAC E3 activity or whether LUBAC affects OTULIN deubi- quitinating activity are both questions that need to be resolved. Putting aside whether one activity affects the other, it is possible that the nature of this coupling is to ensure rapid disassembly of un- wanted polyUb chains by tethering the deubiquitinating enzyme close to the chain assembly machinery.
The ability of ubiquitination to regulate so many different cellular processes is ascribed to its ability to form a large spectrum of modiﬁcations, ranging from monoubiquitin to polyUb chains, with different linkages. Having enzymes that disassemble speciﬁc types of chains has been useful in uncovering the role of particular types of Ub modiﬁcations. The discovery of an enzyme, OTULIN, that speciﬁcally disassembles linear chains not only advances our mechanistic understanding of linear Ub processing but also provides an invaluable tool for investigating the functions of this unique type of polyUb chain.

Fixing a Hole Where the Ras Gets In

A clinically efﬁcacious Ras inhibitor has eluded drug-discovery efforts for decades. In a paper in Nature, Zimmermann and et al. show that blocking a hole in PDEd that normally engages the lipid tail of Ras disrupts downstream signaling, pointing to a potentially promising route to develop Ras inhibitors for cancer treatment.
Activating Ras mutations are found very frequently in human cancers (Schubbert et al., 2007). In particular, mutations in the K-Ras isoform are prevalent in cer- vical, lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers and are associated with a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, no clinically viable drugs have yet been developed to inhibit Ras signaling directly. Ras binds to guanosine diphosphate and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) with picomolar afﬁn- ity, making it challenging to develop competitive inhibitors for the nucleotide- binding pocket, given the abundance of free nucleotides in the cell. An intense effortto block Ras maturation by targeting Ras farnesyl transferases appears to have stalled. Given the demand for small mole- cule inhibitors that target Ras signaling, investigators have been searching for alternative approaches to achieve this end. In a recent issue of Nature, Zimmer- mann et al. (2013) report exciting new
ﬁndings on the inhibition of Ras signaling by targeting the Ras-binding protein PDEd, which has a deep pocket that ap- pears most welcoming to small molecules (Zimmermann et al., 2013).
Ras activity arises from the combined actions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which cause the release of bound nucleotide and subsequent binding of GTP, and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that accelerate hydrolysis of Ras- bound GTP (Cherﬁls and Zeghouf, 2013). Oncogenic Ras mutations subvert GAP- induced GTP hydrolysis, leading to constitutive signaling. An additional level of regulation is made possible by the fact that lipid modiﬁcations at the C termi- nus of Ras-family proteins are necessary for function. These lipid anchors control the ﬁnal destination within the cell of different Ras isoforms and limit the free diffusion of the proteins through the cyto- plasm. PDEd controls the intracellular
localization of Ras-like proteins by bind- ing to their farnesyl tails (Figure 1). In this way, PDEd enhances the cytoplasmic diffusion of Ras, allowing it to distribute to the proper subcellular compartments where signaling is initiated (Chandra et al., 2012; Nancy et al., 2002).
PDEd was discovered originally as a subunit of phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) in photoreceptor cells, where it likely plays a role in binding to the lipid tails of the PDE6 catalytic subunits. The farnesyl anchor at the C terminus of Ras and other proteins is recognized by a hydrophobic hole in the immunoglobulin-like b sand- wich fold of PDEd (Ismail et al., 2011). The action of PDEd is similar to that of Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation in- hibitors (GDIs) (Hanzal-Bayer et al., 2002), which also use a b sandwich fold to recognize the geranylgeranyl moiety of the Rho GTPase. RhoGDIs employ a second domain to contact the switch I
