Macrophages play key roles in obesity-associated pathophys- iology,includinginflammation,atherosclerosis,andcancer,and processes that affect the survival-death balance of macrophages may have an important impact on obesity-related diseases. Adi- pocytesandothercellssecreteaproteincalledextracellularnic- otinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNampt; also known as pre-Bcellcolonyenhancingfactororvisfatin),andplasmalevels of eNampt increase in obesity. Herein we tested the hypothesis that eNampt could promote cell survival in macrophages sub- jected to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process associ- ated with obesity and obesity-associated diseases. We show that eNampt potently blocks macrophage apoptosis induced by a number of ER stressors. The mechanism involves a two-step sequentialprocess:rapidinductionofinterleukin6(IL-6)secre- tion, followed by IL-6-mediated autocrine/paracrine activation of the prosurvival signal transducer STAT3. The ability of eNampttotriggerthisIL-6/STAT3cellsurvivalpathwaydidnot depend on the presence of the Nampt enzymatic substrate nic- otinamide in the medium, could not be mimicked by the Nampt enzymatic product nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), was not blocked by the Nampt enzyme inhibitor FK866, and showed no correlation with enzyme activity in a series of site-directed mutant Nampt proteins. Thus, eNampt protects macrophages from ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating an IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway via a nonenzymatic mechanism. These data suggest a novel action and mechanism of eNampt that could affect the balance of macrophage survival and death in the set- ting of obesity, which in turn could play important roles in obe- sity-associated diseases.

Macrophage biology is intimately related to obesity-associ- ated pathology. For example, inflammatory macrophages are numerousinadiposetissueofobeseindividuals(1,2),andmac- rophage-mediatedinflammationisacriticalcomponentofobe- sity-induced insulin resistance (2, 3). Macrophages also play a critical role in the progression of atherosclerosis, which is the process behind the leading cause of death in obese and insulin- resistant subjects, atherothrombotic vascular disease (4). Obe- sity is associated with an increased risk for certain cancers, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)3 play a critical role in the development of these tumors (5–7). In all processes involv- ing macrophages, a critical determinant of outcome is the sur- vival-death balance of the cells. For example, macrophage apo- ptosis, when coupled with effective phagocytic clearance (efferocytosis)ofthedeadcells,suppressesinflammation(8).In atherosclerosis, macrophage apoptosis limits plaque progres- sion in relatively early lesions, where efferocytosis is intact (9–12). In cancer, targeted apoptosis of TAMs suppresses tumor development (7). Thus, increased macrophage survival in obesity, perhaps mediated by circulating bioactive proteins whoselevelschangewithincreasedbodymassindex(“adipocy- tokines”) (13, 14), may promote the aforementioned obesity- associated diseases.
An adipocytokine that has received much recent attention is a secreted form of an enzyme called nicotinamide phosphori- bosyltransferase (Nampt; also known as pre-B cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF) or visfatin), which converts nicotina- mide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (15, 16). In ver- tebrates, intracellular Nampt plays an essential role in the bio- synthesisofNADfromnicotinamide(17).However,adipocytes and other cells secrete Nampt through a nonclassical, brefeldin A-independent pathway into the extracellular medium in vitro and into the circulation in vivo (18–20). Recent studies have shown that plasma levels of circulating Nampt/PBEF/visfatin, referred to here as extracellular Nampt (eNampt), are elevated in obese humans, including those with type 2 diabetes (21–24).

eNampt has been implicated in a number of biological pro- cesses. For example, eNampt was initially identified as a cyto- kine, called PBEF, that can promote the maturation of B cell precursors and inhibit neutrophil apoptosis (19). Later work revealed proinflammatory actions of the protein in vitro and in mice, as well as a positive association among obesity, eNampt plasma levels, and inflammation in humans (14, 25). The issue as to whether these cytokine-like effects of eNampt depend on Nampt enzymatic activity has generally not been investigated, althougharecentstudyhasimplicatedNamptenzymaticactiv- ity in enhancing the inflammatory response of macrophages to LPS (26).
In another set of studies in which eNampt was named “visfa- tin,” a group of investigators reported that the protein could activate insulin receptor signaling in cultured cells and in vivo through direct interaction with the insulin receptor (27). How- ever, the authors have recently retracted the publication due to problems reproducing these results (28). More recently, Revollo et al. (20) showed that eNampt enhances glucose-stim- ulated insulin secretion in pancreatic (cid:1) cells in vitro and in nonobese mice. This effect of the protein was shown not to be mediated through activation of insulin receptor signaling but rather involved the extracellular enzymatic conversion of nico- tinamide to NMN by eNampt, leading to increased NAD bio- synthesis in (cid:1)cells (20).
Given that eNampt levels are increased in obesity and that macrophages play important roles in obesity-associated dis- eases, we questioned at a cell biological level whether eNampt might influence the survival-death balance of macrophages. In particular, increased macrophage survival might enhance the proposed inflammatory effects of eNampt (see above). We focused on an apoptosis inducer, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, that occurs in obesity and is likely to be relevant to obe- sity-associated diseases. For example, ER stress is a critical process in obesity-associated insulin resistance and inflamma- tion (29, 30), and evidence suggests that ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis occurs in atherosclerotic lesions (31– 35), particularly in the setting of insulin resistance (36). ER stress is also prominent in tumors, where it may affect TAMs (37). Using models of ER stress-induced apoptosis, we show here that eNampt potently blocks macrophage apoptosis. The cell survival pathway is mediated by STAT3, which is activated in an autocrine/paracrine manner by eNampt-induced IL-6. The ability of eNampt to activate STAT3 involves neither insu- lin receptor signaling nor the nicotinamide phosphoribosyl- transferase activity of the protein, suggesting a nonenzymatic signaling role for the protein in this pathway. These findings have potential implications for how obesity might affect mac- rophageapoptosis-survivalbalance,withpotentialimplications formacrophage-mediatedobesity-associateddiseasesaswellas for the mechanisms of action of eNampt.

Tong (Columbia University, New York).
Preparation of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages and Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Unless otherwise noted, the mice used in this study were female C57BL6/J mice, 8–10 weeks of age. Peritoneal macrophages were elicited by intrap- eritoneal injection of methyl-bovine serum albumin in mice previouslyimmunizedwiththisantigenaspreviouslydescribed (40). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 20% L-cell- conditioned medium for 24–48 h, at which time the cells were (cid:3)80–90% confluent. Mouse bone marrow cells were collected by flushing femurs with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 (cid:4) g for 5 min, and the cellpelletwasresuspendedinmacrophagemedium(above)and cultured for 9–11 days to allow differentiation into mature macrophages.
Apoptosis Induction and Assays—Apoptosis was induced by simultaneous or separate activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (31, 32,41,42)or,inthecaseofFig.1B,with5(cid:2)g/mlstaurosporine. For simultaneous UPR/PRR activation, macrophages were incubated for 20 h with 50 (cid:2)g/ml acetyl-LDL plus 10 (cid:2)g/ml acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, SA 58-035. For separateUPR/PRRactivation,macrophageswereincubatedfor 24 h with 5 (cid:2)g/ml tunicamycin plus 25 (cid:2)g/ml fucoidan. At the end of the incubation period, macrophages were assayed for externalizationofphosphatidylserine,amarkerofearlytomid- stage apoptosis, by staining with Alexa-488-labeled annexin V. Late stage apoptosis, as indicated by increased membrane per- meability, was assayed by staining with propidium iodide (43). For Figs. 3 and 4F, the annexin data were verified by terminal

Thereisevidencethattheoxidized sterol 7-ketocholesterol is present in atherosclerotic lesions, and 7-keto- cholesterol activates the UPR and is proapoptotic(35,45).Asshowninthe leftgraphinFig.1B,7-ketocholesterol induced apoptosis in macrophages, andtheapoptoticresponsewasmark- edly suppressed by eNampt. A more broadly applicable, sterol-independ- ent example of this apoptosis model involves incubating macrophages with the combination of a low dose UPR activator (tunicamycin) and a PRR ligand (fucoidan) (32). eNampt was also very effective at blocking apoptosisinthismodel(rightgraphin Fig. 1B). Interestingly, eNampt also had some survival effect in a non- UPR-based model of apoptosis, incu- bationwiththephosphataseinhibitor staurosporine. Although the decre- aseinstaurosporine-inducedapopto- sis was statistically significant (p (cid:7) 0.01), the effect was considerably less than that observed with UPR-in- duced apoptosis (Fig. 1B).
lytic abilities, different amounts of His-Nampt were used for the wild type and the mutants. Catalytic constants Km and kcat were determined for His-tagged mutant and wild-type proteins by analyzing plots of initial rate measurements at 25 °C under varying nicotinamide concentrations using the KaleidaGraph version 3.6 program (Synergy Software), which calculates con- stants Km and kcat automatically.
Statistics—Data are presented as mean (cid:6) S.E. Unless other- wise noted, the number of samples for each group (n) (cid:2) 4. Absent error bars in the bar graphs signify S.E. values smaller than the graphic symbols. Analysis of variance followed by Tukey post-test (GraphPad Prism 4 version 4.03) was used to determine statistical significance among all groups.
To pursue the mechanism, we first examined the effect of eNampt on PRR expression, which is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis (32). We found that treatment of macrophages with eNampt had no effect on the expression of the type A scavenger receptor or another PRR, CD36, both of which serve as second hits in UPR-induced apo- ptosis (32, 42) (data not shown). Next, in view of the previously postulated, and since retracted, role of eNampt (visfatin) as an insulin receptor agonist (27, 28), we determined whether eNampt could block apoptosis in macrophages harvested from insulin receptor-null mice (36). We found that thapsigargin/ fucoidan-induced apoptosis was blocked by eNampt to the samedegreeinthesemacrophagesasinwild-typemacrophages (data not shown).
RESULTS
Extracellular Nampt Suppresses ER-Stress-induced Macro- phage Apoptosis via Activation of STAT3—ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis requires activation of the UPR-CHOP pathwayplusasecond“hit”involvingPRRactivation(32,42).In one example of this model that may be relevant to atheroscle- rosis, macrophages are incubated with modified lipoproteins that carry out both hits; the lipoproteins bind a PRR called the type A scavenger receptor, and, in the absence of cholesterol re-esterification, lipoprotein-derived unesterified cholesterol accumulates in the ER, alters the ER membrane, and triggers the UPR-CHOP pathway (31, 32, 41). Using this model, we
We next considered another possible mechanism for the cell survival effect of eNampt, namely activation of one or more cell survival signaling pathways. Activated STAT3 can act as a survival signal in a number of cell types (46). As shown in Fig. 2A, eNampt is a potent inducer of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, a marker of STAT3 activation, and the effect was seen with an eNampt concentration as low as 50 ng/ml (Fig. 2B). The ability of eNampt to activate STAT3 was not dependent on macrophage insulin signaling, because the response was the same in insulin receptor-null versus wild-type macrophages (data not shown). However, STAT3 activation was inhibited by the Janus kinase inhibitor AG490 (tyrphostin) (Fig. 2C), consistent with the role of

To establish causation for apoptosis, we knocked down STAT3 expression in macrophages using siRNA. As shown by the immunoblot in Fig. 3A, STAT3 knockdown was achieved using two separate Stat3 siRNA species, whereas
scrambled siRNA did not decrease STAT3 expression. As in Fig. 1, lipoprotein-cholesterol-induced apoptosis was mark- edly suppressed by pretreatment of the cells with eNampt (Fig. 3B, left column of images; quantified data in Fig. 3C). However, suppression of apoptosis by eNampt was largely abrogated in cells treated with the two active Stat3 siRNA species.

eNampt; none of the siRNA species induced apoptosis in non-cholesterol-loaded macrophages, either alone or plus eNampt, and the siRNA did not significantly alter cholester- ol-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Almost identical results were obtained when apoptosis was induced by the UPR activator thapsigargin plus the SRA ligand fucoidan (Fig. 3B, right column of images; quantified data in Fig. 3D) and when the TUNEL assay was used for apoptosis instead of annexin V staining (data not shown).
ExtracellularNamptInducesSTAT3PhosphorylationbyPro- moting the Secretion of an Autocrine/Paracrine Stat3 Activator, Interleukin-6—eNampt could activate STAT3 through a direct effect on macrophages or by inducing the secretion of an auto- crine/paracrine activator, which would then secondarily acti- vateSTAT3.Weconsideredthelatterpossibility,becausewhen eNampt was added directly to macrophages, the onset of STAT3 phosphorylation was delayed for at least 4 h (see Fig. 2A). To test the autocrine/paracrine hypothesis, conditioned medium (CM) was collected from control and eNampt-treated macrophages(“donor”macrophages)andthenaddedto“recip- ient” macrophages for various periods of time (Fig. 4A). The data show that CM from eNampt-treated donor macrophages (eNampt-CM) induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in recipient macrophages after as little as 15 min of incubation. This result could not be explained by a direct effect on the recipient cells of residual eNampt in the CM, because, as men- tioned above, eNampt takes at least 4 h to activate STAT3. This point was proven in a subsequent experiment in which the donor macrophages were incubated with eNampt for 5 h and then chased in eNampt-free medium for 12 h. The 12-h chase CM was also able to activate STAT3 in recipient macrophages after only 30 min of incubation (Fig. 4B). The ability of eNampt to induce the secretion of the STAT3-activating factor was dependentonnewproteinsynthesisinthedonormacrophages, because CM from macrophages treated with eNampt in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not induce STAT3 phosphorylation in recipient macrophages (data not shown).
induced the secretion of both of these cytokines (Fig. 4C). We then tested the ability of neutralizing antibodies against the IL-10 receptor and IL-6 receptor to block the ability of eNampt-CM to activate STAT3 in recipient macrophages. As shownbythedatainFig.4D,theIL-10Rantibodyhadnoeffect, whereastheIL-6RantibodymarkedlysuppressedSTAT3phos- phorylation. In a control experiment, we showed that the IL-10R antibody was effective at blocking STAT3 phosphoryl- ation in macrophages incubated with recombinant IL-10 (data not shown). To further prove the role of IL-6 as the critical STAT3-activating factor in eNampt CM, we showed that anti- IL-6 antibody was also able to block STAT3 phosphorylation in recipient macrophages incubated with eNampt-CM (Fig. 4E). To establish that this eNampt/IL-6 pathway is important for eNampt-mediated survival of ER-stressed macrophages, the effect of eNampt on macrophage apoptosis was tested in the absence or presence of neutralizing IL-6 antibodies, IL-10 antibodies, or both. As shown in Fig. 4F (Expt. #1), the survival effect of eNampt was substantially abrogated by the anti-IL-6 antibody but not by the anti-IL-10 antibody. Very similarresultswereobtainedwhenapoptosiswasassayedusing the TUNEL assay instead of the annexin V assay (data not shown). A repeat experiment with two additional controls is shown in experiment 2 (Expt. #2) in Fig. 4F. Note that anti-IL-6 had no significant effect on apoptosis when added to cholester- ol-loaded cells in the absence of eNampt and that nonimmune IgG had no effect on eNampt-treated, cholesterol-loaded cells. In a separate experiment, we found that conditioned medium from eNampt-treated donor cells did not decrease expression of the proapoptotic UPR effector CHOP in recipient macro- phages (data not shown), indicating that eNampt-induced sur- vival was not mediated through CHOP suppression. In sum- mary, eNampt activates STAT3 in macrophages by first inducingthesecretionofIL-6,whichthensecondarilyactivates STAT3 through interaction with the IL-6 receptor. This path- way is critical for the ability of eNampt to block UPR-induced apoptosis.
We undertook a candidate approach to identify the active factor(s) in eNampt CM. Two STAT3-activating cytokines known to be secreted by macrophages are IL-10 and IL-6 (48), andIL-6canbeinducedbyNampt(25).WefoundthateNampt
Extracellular Nampt-induced STAT3 Phosphorylation Does Not Require Nampt Enzymatic Activity—Two recent reports have shown that signaling/cytokine-like activities of eNampt require its enzymatic activity (20, 26), but most other studies in this area have not addressed this critical issue. To explore this

FIGURE 5. Induction of STAT3 phosphorylation by eNampt does not depend upon nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzymatic activity. A, macrophages were cultured in nicotinamide-free or normal medium for 24 h. The cells were then incubated in the absence (Con) or presence of 100 ng/ml eNampt(eNmt)for24h,andcelllysateswereimmunoblottedfortyrosine-phosphorylatedSTAT3(pY-STAT3)andtotalSTAT3.B,macrophageswereincubated for 18 h with 100 ng/ml eNampt or 1.0 or 2.5 mg/ml NMN, and cell lysates were immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated and total STAT3. C, left blot, macrophages were incubated for 18 h with 500 nM FK866 alone, 100 ng/ml eNampt alone, or 100 ng/ml eNampt (cid:5) 500 nM FK866. Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated and total STAT3. Right blot, a similar experiment was conducted, except 100 ng/ml LPS was used instead of eNampt, based on the protocol of Busso et al. (26). D, in the two experiments shown, macrophages were incubated for 18 h in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml wild-type Nampt (WT) or the indicated Nampt mutants. Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated and total STAT3. kcat/Km data for each mutant, expressed as the percentage of kcat/Km for wild-type Nampt, is indicated above each lane. E, macrophages were incubated for 9 h in the absence or presence 50 or 100 ng/ml wild-type Nampt or the R392A Nampt mutant. Cell culture supernatants were analyzed for the presence of IL-6 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n (cid:2) 6 per condition).
point in the context of eNampt-induced STAT3 activation in macrophages, we first determined whether depletion of the Nampt substrate nicotinamide in the medium could block eNampt-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. We found that eNampt induced STAT3 phosphorylation similarly in macro- phages incubated in control versus nicotinamide-free medium (Fig. 5A). Moreover, STAT3 phosphorylation was not induced by the product of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, NMN(Fig.5B).NotethatNMNcanmimictheeffectofeNampt
on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a scenario in which enzymatic activity of eNampt is required (20). Third, the nico- tinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitor FK866 did not block the ability of eNampt to stimulate the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 5C, left blot). As a positive control for the inhibi- tory action of FK866, we took advantage of the finding of Busso et al. (26) that LPS-induced IL-6 requires endogenous Nampt and is thus inhibited by FK866 (see “Discussion”). As expected fromthisfinding,LPSalsoactivatedSTAT3,andthiseffectwas

markedlyblockedbyFK866(Fig.5C,rightblot).Thesedataalso highlight another important point, namely that the ability of eNampttotriggerIL-6/STAT3signalinginthemacrophagesin the current study cannot be explained by contaminating endo- toxin. This point is further substantiated by the following observations: (a) no other molecules were detected by mass spectrometricanalysisofourNamptpreparation;(b)endotoxin levels were below the limit of detection by the Limulus amebo- cyte lysate assay, and similar results in terms of STAT3 activa- tion and macrophage survival were found with recombinant eNampt made in HEK-293 cells instead of in Escherichia coli; (c) eNampt led to STAT3 phosphorylation equally well in wild- type versus LPS-resistant Myd88(cid:1)/(cid:1) macrophages; and (d) treatment of macrophages with LPS did not mimic the prosur- vival action of eNampt in ER-stressed macrophages (data not shown).
As another test of the idea that the eNampt-induced STAT3 pathway described here does not involve Nampt enzymatic activity, we used a series of Nampt mutants that have varying degreesofenzymaticactivity(44).ThedatainFig. 5D show that there was no correlation between eNampt enzy- matic activity and its ability to activate STAT3. In particular, R392A Nampt, which retains approximately a third of Nampt enzymatic activity, was almost completely unable to activate STAT3 or to stimulate the secretion of IL-6 (Fig. 5, D and E). Conversely, H247E, D219A, and S200D Nampt, which have very low enzymatic activity, were potent stimulators of STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). In summary, the combined data in Fig.5indicatethatthenicotinamidephosphoribosyltransferase activity of eNampt is not needed to activate the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in macrophages.
Extracellular Nampt Is Associated with Increased Levels of Spe- cific Cell Survival Proteins in Cholesterol-loaded Macrophages— STAT3 activation has been linked to cell survival and the induc- tion of cell survival proteins in certain models of apoptosis (46). We therefore hypothesized that eNampt pretreatment of choles- terol-loadedmacrophageswouldincreasethelevelofoneormore cellsurvivalproteins,whichcouldexplainthecellsurvivalactionof eNampt in these cells. In this context, we assayed the levels of five well known macrophage survival proteins, apoptosis inhibitor in macrophages (AIM; SP(cid:3)), Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and inhibitor of apoptosisproteins-1/2(IAP1/2)(Fig.6).Themostimportantanal- ysis involved comparing cholesterol-loaded macrophages with or without eNampt to determine which proteins were increased by eNampt under conditions that eventually lead to apoptosis and protection by eNampt (third and fourth lanes of the immunob- lots). Of the five proteins analyzed, AIM was markedly increased by eNampt under cholesterol-loading conditions, and Mcl-1 and IAP1/2weremodestlyincreased.ThebasallevelofBcl-2wasactu- ally decreased by cholesterol loading, and there was a slight resto- ration of Bcl-2 expression by eNampt treatment of cholesterol- loaded cells. Bcl-xL was not increased by eNampt under these conditions. In non-cholesterol-loaded cells, none of the cell sur- vival proteins were increased by eNampt. These data are consist- entwiththehypothesisthateNamptpromotesthesurvivalofcho- lesterol-loaded macrophages by increasing the expression of certain cell survival proteins, particularly AIM.

DISCUSSION
A critical area of obesity research is centered on circulating proteins whose levels are altered by changes in body mass index. Understanding how these proteins affect obesity-associ- ated diseases may provide invaluable clues to help stem the devastating consequences of the current obesity epidemic (14). One such protein, eNampt/PBEF/visfatin, has received much attention lately, but the biological effects of this molecule and its mechanisms of action are complex and incompletely under- stood. The biological effect studied here, promotion of macro- phage survival, could represent an important process by which elevated levels of eNampt in obesity might influence obesity- associateddisease(seeIntroductionandbelow).Withregardto the mechanism, we have shown that the key signaling pathway that mediates the cell-survival effect of eNampt, autocrine/ paracrine activation of STAT3, does not involve eNampt enzy- matic activity.
We provide four independent pieces of evidence, includ- ing the use of inactive eNampt mutants, to support the con- clusion that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activ- ity is not needed to activate the STAT3 pathway. In theory, the IL-6/STAT3/cell survival pathway shown here could have been caused by a contaminating molecule in our prep- arations of eNampt. However, we subjected our preparation of eNampt to mass spectrometric analysis, and only one mol- ecule, eNampt, was detected (data not shown). Moreover, the IL-6 effect could not be explained by contaminating endotoxin, as described under “Results.” Rather, we hypoth- esize that eNampt stimulates secretion of IL-6 by interacting with a yet to be identified signaling receptor, although not the insulin receptor (data not shown; cf. Ref. 28). In a prelim- inary experiment, we have shown that macrophages sub- jected to Proteinase K-mediated cell surface proteolysis no longer respond to eNampt in terms STAT3 activation (data not shown). However, identification of an “eNampt recep- tor,” if it does exist, will require a major new undertaking.
Although it may seem implausible that cells secrete an enzyme that acts nonenzymatically in triggering cell signaling,

previous work has shown that the extracellular form of phos- phoglucose isomerase induces cellular migration through interactionwithaseven-transmembranedomainreceptor(49). Intriguingly, the only Nampt mutant that lacked STAT3-acti- vating activity was R392A, suggesting that Arg329 somehow plays a role in either cell interaction or its downstream effects. The fact that the S200D mutant retained activity may also be instructive. This mutant cannot form dimers, which is the pre- dominant form of enzymatically active wild-type Nampt (44). Thus,althoughthedimerformisnecessaryforenzymaticactiv- ity, the monomer form may retain cytokine-stimulating activity.
The two mechanistic areas that will require further study include how eNampt triggers IL-6 secretion and how STAT3 activation promotes survival in ER-stressed macrophages. A previous study showed that an inhibitor of the mitogen-acti- vated protein kinase p38 could block eNampt-induced IL-6 mRNAandIL-6proteinsecretionfromhumanmonocytes(25). However, there were no data in this study addressing the involvement or lack thereof of eNampt enzymatic activity. In terms of the cell survival effect of STAT3, there is evidence of increasedapoptosisinStat3(cid:1)/(cid:1)mice,andSTAT3-inducedsur- vival in cultured cells has been associated with induction of a number of cell survival molecules, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1,andsurvivin(46).ThedatainFig.6showthatseveralcell survival proteins, particularly AIM, are increased in eNampt- pretreated cholesterol-loaded macrophages. Future experi- ments in which STAT3 and the cell survival proteins are sile- nced will be needed to definitively establish the hypothesized pathway,namelyeNampt3STAT33AIM/Mcl-1/IAP3cell survival. Beyond the cell survival effect of STAT3 signaling, Nowell et al. (50) suggested that IL-6/STAT3 signaling can actually induce Nampt itself, which, if applicable to macro- phages, might represent an amplifying positive feedback loop. In terms of the biological end point investigated here, how might enhancement of macrophage survival by eNampt have an impact on obesity-related processes? Macrophage apoptosis has been proposed to be one mechanism of curbing inflamma- tion after an initial host defense response (51). Prolonged sur- vival of these cells, therefore, may bolster the inflammatory response known to be important in obesity (1–3), particularly in the setting of ER stress, where the inflammatory response is enhanced (52–55). In addition, the autocrine/paracrine factor that initiates the STAT3-mediated cell survival pathway, IL-6, directly promotes inflammation (56). As mentioned above, an enzymatic Nampt pathway enhances IL-6 secretion in LPS-ac- tivated macrophages (26), and this process could complement the nonenzymatic pathway shown.
In another scenario, prolonged macrophage survival has been shown to promote the early progression of macrophage- rich atherosclerotic lesions (9, 10), another hallmark of obesity. Thisconceptisnottobeconfusedwiththepronecroticeffectof macrophage apoptosis in advanced plaques, where efferocyto- sisisdefective(11,12).Eveninadvancedlesions,however,sim- ply promoting macrophage survival may result in detrimental effects associated with living macrophages in these plaques, such as secretion of inflammatory cytokines, matrix proteases, and tissue factor (57).

A third possible link is related to the known role of IL-6/ STAT3 signaling, including antiapoptotic pathways, in pro- moting cancer (58), another obesity-associated disease (5). In particular, an eNampt-mediated survival effect on tumor cells or, apropos to the current study, TAMs might promote tumor development (6). Interestingly, TAMs have a particularly important role in prostate cancer, one of the major cancers associated with obesity (5, 59). If so, these effects of eNampt maycomplementanNAD-mediatedsurvivaleffectofenzymat- ically active Nampt on tumor cells themselves (60).
Whether or not macrophage survival and the hypothesized consequences are increased in obesity in an eNampt-depend- entmannermustawaitthecreationofconditionaleNampt-null mice, because Nampt(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice die in utero (20). However, the concentration of eNampt used in our cell culture studies is in the range of eNampt measured in the circulation of obese mice and humans (21–24). Indeed, studies in humans have shown positivecorrelationsamongobesity,plasmaeNamptlevels,and inflammatory markers, including IL-6 (14, 25). Moreover, we showed that intravenous injection of mice with eNampt acti- vates STAT3 in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 2D). In addition, locally synthesized eNampt, including that in adipose tissue (20) and atherosclerotic lesions (61), may result in high local concentrations of the protein.
In summary, eNampt stimulates an IL-6/STAT3-mediated cell survival pathway in macrophages through a nonenzymatic mechanism. These actions may account for alterations in mac- rophage physiology in the setting of obesity, where eNampt levels are elevated. The consequences of such macrophage alterationscouldmediatetheeffectsofobesityininflammation, atherogenesis, and tumorigenesis. Future genetic manipula- tions of eNampt in mice will be needed to test these ideas in vivo.
