Abstract: Lysine propionylation is a recently identified post-translational modification that has been observed in proteins such as p53 and histones and is thought to play a role similar to acetylation in modulating protein activity. Members of the sirtuin family of deacetylases have been shown to have depropionylation activity, although the way in which the sirtuin catalytic site accommodates the bulkier propionyl group is not clear. We have determined the 1.8 A˚ structure of a Thermotoga maritima sirtuin, Sir2Tm, bound to a propionylated peptide derived from p53. A comparison with the structure of Sir2Tm bound to an acetylated peptide shows that hydrophobic residues in the active site shift to accommodate the bulkier propionyl group. Isothermal titration calorimetry data show that Sir2Tm binds propionylated substrates more tightly than acetylated substrates, but kinetic assays reveal that the catalytic rate of Sir2Tm deacylation of propionyl- lysine is slightly reduced to acetyl-lysine. These results serve to broaden our understanding of the newly identified propionyl-lysine modification and the ability of sirtuins to depropionylate, as well as deacetylate, substrates.

and Biophysical Chemistry,
various lysine residues on histones governs chroma- tin structure and regulates transcription, whereas acetylation of metabolic enzymes, such as acetyl-CoA synthetase, has been found to regulate their activ- ity.1 Recent studies have identified the presence of two novel acyl modifications of lysine, propionylation and butyrylation,2 in proteins such as histones,2 pro- pionyl-CoA synthetase,3 and p53.4 These modifica- tions are chemically similar to acetylation but have one or two extra methylene groups, respectively, making the modifications bulkier and more hydro- phobic (Fig. 1). Like acetyltransferases, which use acetyl-CoA as the acetyl group donor, propionyl- transferases and butyryltransferases catalyze trans- fer of the acyl group from propionyl-CoA and bu- tyryl-CoA, respectively, to the e-nitrogen of lysine. Previously identified acetyltransferases such as the GCN5 family of acetyltransferases and P300 can uti- lize either acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA to acetylate or propionylate substrates, respectively.3,4 Although

less is known about the role of the propionyl and bu- tyryl modifications, they are likely to serve a func- tion similar to acetylation in regulating complex bio- logical networks. In an example where a biological role for this modification has been well-established, propionylation of Salmonella enterica propionyl-CoA synthetase inactivates the enzyme,3 thereby serving as a negative regulator of propionyl-CoA synthesis, much in the way that acetylation regulates the ac- tivity of acetyl-CoA synthetase.1
Protein acetylation is reversed by lysine deace- tylase enzymes, which remove the acetyl group to residue. Sir2 regenerate an unmodified lysine (sirtuins) are NADþ-dependent enzymes lysine deacetylases that cleave NADþ during deacetylation, releasing nicotinamide and the metabolite, O-acetyl- ADP-ribose (OAADPR), as products.5,6 Sirtuins have been shown to deacetylate histones,7 p53,8,9 a-tubu- lin,10 and acetyl-CoA synthetase1 and regulate numerous biological processes, including transcrip- tional repression,11 rDNA recombination,12,13 apopto- sis,9 fat mobilization,14 and metabolism.1 Sirtuins have in common a conserved catalytic core15–21 and are found in all three domains of life, with many organisms possessing multiple sirtuin homologs.11,22 Although deacetylation is the principal activity of most sirtuins, not all sirtuins have been shown to deacetylate lysines, and some sirtuins can catalyze other reactions. Indeed, sirtuins were first identified as ADP-ribosyltransferases,22–24 although subse- quent research has revealed that this is likely a minor activity catalyzed by only some sirtuins.6,7 These findings, along with the discoveries of new ly- sine acyl modifications, have sparked interest in other potential activities of sirtuins.
Recent studies have revealed that a subset of sir- tuins can also catalyze depropionylation and debutyr- ylation in vitro and in vivo with varying catalytic effi- ciency.3,25 The sirtuin depropionylation reaction is similar to deacetylation, except that O-propionyl- ADP-ribose (OPADPR) is formed instead of OAADPR as a product.3,26 Modeling of sirtuins bound to propio- nyl- or butyryl-lysine suggested that the enzyme active site should be able to accommodate the propio- nyl group with minor rearrangements, but that bind- ing of the bulkier butyryl modification would require more significant to avoid steric rearrangement clashes.3,25 Interestingly, the yeast sirtuin, Hst2, was shown to bind to both propionylated and butyrylated

To gain insight into the basis for the various deacylation activities of sirtuins, we deter- mined the crystal structure of a sirtuin from Thermo- toga maritima, Sir2Tm, bound to a propionylated sub- strate and studied the binding of substrate and reaction kinetics of Sir2Tm depropionylation and deacetylation. These studies provide a structural and thermodynamic basis for the observed plasticity of the sirtuin active site and provide a model for under- standing how other sirtuins catalyze removal of a va- riety of acyl modifications from lysine side chains.

Sir2Tm depropionylates a propionylated p53 peptide A previous study on sirtuin-mediated depropionyla- tion reported that Sir2Tm can depropionylate propionyl-CoA synthetase from S. enterica in vitro.3 In this study, we tested the depropionylation activity of Sir2Tm on a peptide substrate derived from the C-terminus of the p53 tumor suppressor protein that has been used in previous structural studies of Sir2Tm.20,21,27 We confirmed that Sir2Tm can also efficiently depropionylate the p53 peptide with kinetics comparable to the deacetylation reaction (Fig. 2). The catalytic turnover rate (kcat) was 0.102

Rates of reaction were measured by an NADþ consumption assay.21 The reactions were performed with 50 lg/mL Sir2Tm and 1 mM NADþ for 15 min at 37(cid:1)C. Concentration of the substrate peptides was varied from 12.5 lM to 1 mM.

We observed similar apparent KM values of 87.37 6 23.94 lM and 103.71 6 21.37 lM, for propionylated and acetylated p53 peptides, respectively.

to substrate binding affinity, we used isothermal ti- tration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the thermody- namic parameters of Sir2Tm binding to both sub- strates. Binding experiments performed at 25(cid:1)C showed that Sir2Tm binds the propionylated p53 peptide 4.4-fold more tightly, with a KD of 0.183 6 0.017 lM when compared with 0.799 6 0.038 lM for the acetylated form of the peptide [Fig. 3(a,b)]. This difference in binding affinity was unexpected given the similarity in KM values.

We hypothesized that the tighter binding affin- ity of Sir2Tm to propionyl-lysine may be due to favorable interactions between the additional meth- ylene group of propionyl-lysine with residues in the Sir2Tm.

the change in heat capacity (DCp) of Sir2Tm binding to both propionylated and acetylated p53 substrates. Measurement of DCp can reveal the contribution of polar and nonpolar interactions to binding, with a more negative DCp reflecting more hydrophobic interactions.28 ITC titrations were conducted at two additional temperatures (15 and 20(cid:1)C) for both pep- tides (Table I). The DH values obtained for both sub- strates were plotted as a function of temperature to determine the slope [Fig. 3(c)], which gave DCp val- ues for propionylated and acetylated substrates of (cid:2)318.8 6 2.7 and (cid:2)292.6 6 3.8 cal mol(cid:2)1 K(cid:2)1, respectively. The more negative DCp for the propio- nylated peptide as compared to the acetylated pep- tide indicates that the tighter binding of Sir2Tm to propionylated substrates versus acetylated sub- strates is likely due to the greater hydrophobicity of propionyl-lysine compared with acetyl-lysine.
Structure of Sir2Tm bound to a propionylated p53 peptide To understand the structural basis for the observed binding and kinetic constants for propionylated sub- strates, we determined the structure of Sir2Tm in complex with the propionylated p53 peptide at 1.8 A˚ resolution; crystallographic statistics are summar- ized in Table II. As expected, the overall structure is similar to the previously reported crystal structure of Sir2Tm bound to an acetylated p53 peptide,20 with all differences located in the enzyme active site [Fig. 4(a)]. Simulated annealing omit maps con- firmed the presence and proper orientation of the propionyl moiety and the surrounding residues [Fig. 4(b)].
The binding of propionyl-lysine to Sir2Tm gives rise to changes in the conformations of several resi- dues in the Sir2Tm active site as compared to the acetyl-lysine bound structure [Fig. 4(c)]. Both acetyl- and propionyl-lysine fit into the active site of Sir2Tm in a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues F48, I100, and I159. However, rearrangements of these active site residues were critical to accommo- date the bulkier propionyl group as compared to ace- tyl-lysine, and to form optimal interactions with the substrate [Fig. 4(c)]. In particular, I159 and F48 make the most extensive contacts with propionyl-ly- sine and differ the most in conformation from the acetyl-lysine bound structure.20 Isoleucine 159
adopts an alternative sidechain rotamer in the pro- pionyl-lysine bound structure, resulting in an orien- tation of the short methyl arm of the isoleucine side- chain pointing toward the terminal methyl group of the propionyl moiety [Fig. 4(c)]. This rotation decreases the distance by 0.25 A˚ between this resi- due and the terminal methyl of propionyl-lysine as compared to the position of I159 in the acetyl-lysine bound structure. This results in more extensive van der Waals interactions between the propionyl group and the isoleucine side chain. The alternate rotamer of I159, in turn, creates room for the sidechain of I100 to shift away slightly from the propionyl-lysine, thereby eliminating steric clash between the propio- nyl group and active site residues. To accommodate the change in the orientation of I159, V119 also adopts a different rotamer, pointing away from the active site residues and thereby eliminating steric clashes with I159 [Fig. 4(c)]. Phenylalanine 48 also shifts its position in the Sir2Tm active site to accom- modate the larger propionyl modification. In the structure of acetylated peptide bound to Sir2Tm, all phenyl ring carbons of Sir2Tm F48 are more than 4 A˚ away from the acetyl modification. However, bind- ing to the propionyl moiety causes the phenyl ring of

Discussion The kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural studies presented here provide fresh insights into the depro- pionylation activity of sirtuins and how the enzyme active site can accommodate propionylated sub- strates, and potentially other, larger acyl modifica- tions. The structure of Sir2Tm bound to a propiony- lated peptide shows that rearrangements of key residues in the active site both allow the enzyme active site to accommodate the bulkier propionyl-ly- sine modification and give rise to more extensive contacts with the propionyl group as compared to an acetyl group. These additional hydrophobic interac- tions account for the 4.4-fold lower KD observed for the propionylated peptide and the more negative DCp value for the propionylated substrate as com- pared to the acetylated substrate. A higher affinity for more hydrophobic acyl modifications has also been observed for the yeast sirtuin, Hst2,25 suggest- ing that this is likely a common property of many sirtuins.
Despite the 4.4-fold higher binding affinity for propionyl-lysine compared with acetyl-lysine, the kcat/KM value for depropionylation and deacetylation are comparable. A lower KD for Sir2Tm binding to propionyl-lysine would suggest an increase in kcat/KM, as this rate constant for sirtuin-mediated enzymatic reactions reflects the first steps in deacy- lation through nicotinamide cleavage.6,29–33 A num- ber of reasons can account for this disparity. The additional methylene moiety of propionyl-lysine may enhance the affinity of Sir2Tm for this substrate at the expense of decreased catalysis. Smith et al.26 demonstrated that the nucleophilicity of the car- bonyl oxygen of the propionyl moiety is decreased compared with the acetyl carbonyl oxygen, lowering the rate of sirtuin-mediated NADþ cleavage for depropionylation compared with deacetylation.26 The discrepancy between KD and kcat/KM values may also be a result of nonproductive binding of propionyl-ly- sine in the Sir2Tm active site and would manifest itself as an increase in binding affinity without a concomitant increase in kcat/KM.34 It is possible that a nonproductive binding mode exists for propionyl- lysine binding, but that the subsequent binding of NADþ induces productive binding.
The catalytic turnover rate, kcat, is determined by the rate-limiting step,35 which for sirtuin deacety- lation is thought to be product release of deacety- lated peptide or OAADPR, which are released in random order.32,33 The 1.38-fold difference observed in kcat between depropionylation and deacetylation

is likely due to slower release of the OPADPR prod- uct than OAADPR because of tighter binding of the propionyl moiety to the Sir2Tm enzyme. Given that the propionyl group enhances the affinity of Sir2Tm for substrate, it is plausible that the affinity for pro- pionylated product would also be enhanced.
The structure of Sir2Tm bound to a propiony- lated p53 peptide presented here shows how this enzyme accommodates the bulkier propionyl modifi- cation. Although some residues are shifted away from the modification in the active site to provide more space for the extra methylene in propionyl-ly- sine, some side chains are reoriented so that they make more favorable contacts with propionyl-lysine. In particular, the coupled change in rotamer of both I159 and V119 plays an essential role in accommo- dating the propionyl group and in forming favorable van der Waals interactions with the modification [Fig. 4(c)]. An additional shift of the F48 side chain also makes larger modification. Although a previous study3 presented a model for how the propionyl group could be accommodated through relatively small shifts in Sir2Tm active site residues, our structural studies reveal that more sig- nificant rearrangements, in fact, take place. We also note that the propionyl group itself adopts a differ- ent rotamer in the crystal structure than that used in modeling studies,3 which could not have been anticipated from the molecular modeling. The propi- onyl rotamer observed in the crystal structure is more readily accommodated in the Sir2Tm active site.

The observed differences in the conformations of Sir2Tm residues in complexes containing acetylated versus propionylated peptide substrates offer insight into the differing depropionylation and debutyryla- tion activity observed among various sirtuin homo- logs.3,25 Although I159 is highly conserved and is ei- ther an isoleucine or valine, structural alignment of sirtuins shows that V119 is not conserved, with hydrophobic side chains such as leucine, methionine, or even phenylalanine replacing this residue. The ability of residues corresponding to I159 and V119 to adopt conformations that can accommodate different chemical groups will likely affect the depropionyla- tion and debutyrylation activity of various sirtuins. As the rotamers of I159 and V119 are coupled dur- ing substrate binding, sequence variation at the resi- due analogous to V119 could govern the ability of sirtuins to bind to larger acyl modifications. Another key residue involved in substrate binding is F48 of Sir2Tm, which contacts the terminal methyl of the propionyl group and is found as either a phenylala- nine or an alanine in other sirtuins. Sirtuins with an alanine in this position may be more likely to accommodate acyl modifications larger than acetyla- tion, whereas a phenylalanine at this site may or may not affect binding, depending on the flexibility

of this residue. At the same time, the central role of hydrophobic interactions in the binding of modified lysine residues suggests that the van der Waals interactions with F48 and I159 likely contribute favorably to peptide binding. Whether or not a given sirtuin can catalyze removal of modifications larger than an acetyl group likely depends on the fine bal- ance between favorable hydrophobic interactions and unfavorable steric clashes in the active site in accommodating the modification.
Modeling studies of yeast sirtuin Hst2 binding to various acylated lysines by Smith et al.25 sug- gested that the residues analogous to F48, I100, and I159 of Sir2Tm (F67, I117, and I181 in Hst2) would require significant movement to accommodate bu- tyryl-lysine in the active site with severe steric clash. Surprisingly, Hst2 binds more tightly to bu- tyryl-lysine than to acetyl-lysine, although the debutyrylation activity was substantially lower than depropionylation activity.25 By analogy with our findings on Sir2Tm, it is possible that different rotamers of butyryl-lysine, as well as propionyl-ly- sine, could be accommodated in the Hst2 active site, perhaps facilitated by side chain rotamer shifts in the enzyme.
Although our results highlight the importance of enzyme active site and substrate conformations in governing whether or not a sirtuin is capable of depropionylation, the specificity of a given sirtuin for different peptide sequences may also play a role in regulating depropionylation activity, as is demon- strated in the case of human SIRT1. SIRT1 was ini- tially reported to lack depropionylase activity based on an in vitro assay for depropionylation of S. enter- ica propionyl-CoA synthetase, whereas other sirtuins including Sir2Tm did demonstrate depropionylation activity with this substrate.3 However, subsequent studies demonstrated that SIRT1 depropionylates histone H3 peptides in vitro25 and p53 in vivo.4 This indicates that, although the SIRT1 active site is able to accommodate and bind propionyl-lysine, impor- tant determinants of substrate specificity depend on the amino acid sequence of the substrate itself, sug- gesting that residues outside the active site govern whether or not SIRT1 can bind to and deacylate a substrate. A previous study of an archaeal sirtuin, Sir2Af1, revealed that sirtuin affinity for its sub- strate could be altered by mutations to surface resi- dues surrounding the active site.21 It is likely that, although the enzyme active site is adaptable enough to bind propionyl-lysine, SIRT1 surface residues gov- ern whether or not the enzyme can make favorable contacts with the rest of the substrate as a means for providing substrate specificity.
Sirtuins are a remarkable example of active site plasticity, which allows members of this enzyme family to bind to different types of acyl substrates. Our study provides a first step in understanding the

structural rearrangements in both the enzyme active site and the substrate that enable Sir2Tm to bind to both acetylated and propionylated substrates. These insights can provide a basis for modeling studies of sirtuins bound to different substrates and drugs that target members of this important class of enzyme.
Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification Sir2Tm was expressed in E. coli and purified as pre- viously described.36 Purified Sir2Tm was dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and concentrated to 16 mg/mL. The protein was flash frozen in liquid nitro- gen in small aliquots and stored at (cid:2)80(cid:1)C until thawed for enzyme assays or crystallization.

Stock peptide solution was made at 40 mM in deion- ized water neutralized with sodium hydroxide.
Enzymatic activity assays Kinetics of Sir2Tm depropionylation and deacetyla- tion were measured with a standard NADþ con- sumption assay.21 Sir2Tm (50 lg/mL) was incubated with 1 mM NADþ and acylated peptide substrates ranging in concentration from 12.5 lM to 1 mM for 15 min at 37(cid:1)C. Under these conditions, steady-state initial velocities are maintained. Unconsumed NADþ was quantified by enzymatic conversion of NADþ to NADH, the latter of which can be measured spectro- photometrically at a wavelength of 340 nM.21 NADþ concentration measured this way is linear to at least 1 mM. The reaction progress at each timepoint was measured three times in independent experiments. The data were globally fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation [Eq.

The enzyme–substrate complex was set in crystallization drops at a 1:1 ratio with a well solution of 9.5% PEG3350 and 100 mM CHES, pH 8.5 at 20(cid:1)C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals appeared after 1–2 days and were harvested after 5 days. For storage and data collec- tion, crystals were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 10.5% PEG 3350, 100 mM CHES, pH 8.5, and 15% ethylene glycol and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Crystallographic data collection and structure determination Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Bio- CARS 14-BM-C beamline at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory using an ADSC Q315 detector. The data were indexed and scaled using HKL2000.37 The complex crystallized in the same space group and with similar cell dimen- sions as crystals of Sir2Tm bound to an acetylated p53 peptide. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with REFMAC5, using the coordinates of the Sir2Tm protein only from the structure of Sir2Tm bound to a peptide and NADþ (PDB ID 2H4F and 2H2D).27 Subsequent building and refine- ments were performed with the graphics program COOT38 and REFMAC5 from the CCP4 suite.39
After the first few rounds of refinement, an unmodified version of the p53 peptide was built into the model. Positive density in both the 2Fo-Fc map contoured at 1r and Fo-Fc map contoured at 3r indicated that the propionyl modification was indeed present and well defined. After several rounds of refinement, the propionyl modification was intro- followed by further rounds of refinement. duced, Simulated annealing omit maps were calculated with the propionyl moiety of the p53 peptide omitted using CNS.41,42 The final structure contains residues 1–33 and 43–246 of Sir2Tm, 1 zinc atom, residues 2–14 of the peptide, and 247 water molecules.
