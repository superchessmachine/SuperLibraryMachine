Abstract
Peptidyl arms extending from one protein domain to another protein domain mediate many important interactions in biology. A well-studied example of this type of protein–protein interaction occurs between the yeast homeodomain proteins, MAT (cid:1)2 and MAT a1, which form a high-affinity heterodimer on DNA. The carboxyl-terminal arm extending from MAT (cid:1)2 to MAT a1 has been proposed to produce an allosteric conformational change in the a1 protein that generates a very large increase in the DNA binding affinity of a1. Although early studies lent some support to this model, a more recent crystal structure determination of the free a1 protein argues against any allosteric change. This note presents a thermodynamic argument that accounts for the proteins’ binding behavior, so that allosteric conformational changes are not required to explain the large affinity increase. The analysis presented here should be useful in analyzing binding behavior in other systems involving arm interactions.

Peptidyl arms or tails mediate interactions between proteins in a wide variety of processes, including DNA replication (Berdis et al. 1996; Sanders et al. 1997), signaling (Sano et al. 1997), vesicle transport (ter Haar et al. 2000), apoptosis (Shi 2002), and regulation by proteins like AraC (Saviola et al. 1997; Soisson et al. 1997; Seabold and Schleif 1998), and homeodomain proteins (Mak and Johnson 1993; Piper et al. 1999; LaRonde-LeBlanc and Wolberger 2003). An important paradigm for peptidyl arm–domain interactions is found in the interaction between the yeast homeodomain proteins, MAT (cid:1)2 and MAT a1. The proteins bind to ad- jacent sites on the DNA and contacts between the proteins are mediated by a flexible carboxyl-terminal tail of (cid:1)2 that

becomes ordered upon binding to a1 (Wolberger et al. 1991; Mak and Johnson 1993). The binding of the carboxyl-ter- minal tail of MAT (cid:1)2 to the globular protein domain of MAT a1 dramatically increases the DNA binding affinity of both proteins, and the large increase in binding affinity has been attributed to allosteric effects of the bound peptidyl tail that reshape the MAT a1 protein so as to increase its DNA binding affinity (Stark et al. 1999). Although structures of the two proteins have been interpreted to suggest the exis- tence of such changes (Anderson et al. 2000; Ke et al. 2002), a more recent report of the structure of MAT a1 protein has raised the possibility that allosteric structural changes may not be required (Ke and Wolberger 2003). We show here that a very large cooperativity in DNA binding by two proteins interacting via an arm can result from the binding energetics of the arm, independent of any allosteric effects. Such a cooperative effect, whether mediated by an arm or not, can arise when the two interacting components are held near one another. This general mechanism for gen- erating cooperativity has been well described (Creighton

Consider two proteins, P and Q, whose dissociation con- stants from their respective DNA binding sites are Kp and Kq, and whose binding sites on DNA are positioned such that, when P and Q are both bound, an arm extending from P can bind to Q and that the apparent solution binding affinity of the arm to Q is Karm. Let P, Q, and D represent the concentrations of the free proteins and of DNA, PD and QD the concentrations of the individual complexes, (PQ)D the complex of P and Q on DNA without the arm binding to Q, and (P ∼ Q)D the concentration of PQ complex on DNA with the arm from P bound to Q (Fig. 1). Directly from the definition of the dissociation constants,
PD =
P (cid:1) D , Kp
and
QD =
Q (cid:1)D Kq
Similarly, (PQ)D is obtained from the reaction of PD with Q, that is,
(cid:1)PQ(cid:2)D =
PD (cid:1)Q Kq
and hence
(cid:1)PQ(cid:2)D =
P (cid:1)Q(cid:1)D . (cid:1)Kq
Kp
Binding of the arm to Q is governed by the effective concentration of the arm in the immediate vicinity of its
Figure 1. Pathways of complex formation. Each of these reactions are assumed to be in equilibrium. Only the (PQ)D complex is considered in the formation of the arm-bound complex (P∼4Q) because the concentrations of P and Q are assumed to be much lower than Ceff, the effective concentra- tion of the arm in the vicinity of its binding site on Q when both P and Q are bound to DNA.

binding site on Q, Ceff, and Karm. In solution, the fraction of the protein molecules that bind a ligand is
Ceff + Ceff
Karm
if the concentration of ligand is Ceff and it binds to the protein with a dissociation constant of Karm. Equivalently, the fraction of time that an individual protein molecule in the solution binds the ligand is described by the same equa- tion. Hence, (P ∼ Q)D is proportional to
Ceff + Ceff
Karm
and (PQ)D is proportional to
1 −

making the ratio
(cid:1)P∼ Q(cid:2)D (cid:1)PQ(cid:2)D

Substituting from above,
(cid:1)P ∼ Q(cid:2)D = (cid:1)PQ(cid:2)D (cid:1)
Ceff Karm
=
P (cid:1) Q (cid:1) D (cid:1) Kq

Hence, the apparent binding affinity is increased by the ratio of
Ceff Karm
.
In the case of a1–(cid:1)2, NMR data (Phillips et al. 1994) and calculation of the interaction energies from the crystal struc- ture coordinates (Li et al. 1995), both show that the length of the linker from the end of the structured region of (cid:1)2 to the position of the first significant contact with a1 is two residues, about 10 Å. If we approximate the linker as being flexible, then the nearest binding site on the tail is confined
to the volume within a hemisphere of 10 Å radius (Fig. 2). Hence, the binding target on a1 is exposed to the binding site at a concentration of 1 molecule in a 10 Å radius hemi- sphere, which is an effective solution concentration of about 1 M. Because the binding affinity of the arm is about 2 × 10−4 M (Phillips et al. 1994), the cooperativity from energetic effects can be as large as
Ceff Karm
=
1 M 2 × 10−4 M
= 5 × 103.
(cid:2) 10−5 M, and It has been found experimentally that Ka1 ≈ 10−6 M (Phillips et al. 1994). Using the relationship K(cid:1)2 derived above, the bimolecular dissociation constant can be estimated to be greater than
K(cid:1)1
× K(cid:1)2
×
Karm Ceff
= (cid:1)10−5 M(cid:2) × (cid:1)10−6 M(cid:2) ×
1 5 × 103
= 2 × 10−15 M2.
This is consistent with experimental data showing that the constant is 10−14 M2 to 10−15 M2 (Phillips et al. 1994). Thus, binding energetics are capable of providing all of the coop- erativity that is observed experimentally.
The above calculation, together with the recent crystal- lographic study of the a1 homeodomain in the absence of (cid:1)2 or DNA (Ke and Wolberger 2003) supports that idea that binding energetics are sufficient to account for the observed ability of the (cid:1)2 protein to raise the affinity of a1 for DNA. Because there are many other examples of macromolecular interactions that are mediated by flexible peptide arms, the estimation we present here based on the concept of local concentration (Crothers and Metzger 1972; Margossian and Lowey 1978; Klemm and Pabo 1996) should be instructive in evaluating interactions in other systems and determining whether it is necessary to invoke factors other than simple cooperativity to account for binding behavior.
