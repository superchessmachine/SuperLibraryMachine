Breaking the K48-Chain: Linking Ubiquitin Beyond Protein Degradation

Abstract
The discovery of ubiquitin conjugation to lysines and the role of K48-linked polyubiquitin in targeting substrates for proteasomal degradation was followed by revelation of non-degradative roles of ubiquitination and, more recently, of non-canonical covalent ubiquitin linkages. Here we summarize findings of the ever-expanding array of ubiquitin signals and their biological roles.
Post-translational modifications of proteins play important roles in regulating protein structure and function. Our understanding of the biological function of ubiquitin has evolved significantly since its initial discovery by Goldstein in 19751, who isolated ubiquitin while attempting to isolate thymopoietin. Reflecting its conservation across various cell types and organisms, ubiquitin was initially referred to as ubiquitous immunopoietic polypeptide (UBIP). The discovery that ubiquitin can serve as a post-translational modification came a few years later, when Goldknopf and Busch discovered that the chromatin-associated protein, A24, contained two N-termini but just a single C-terminus2. They showed that A24 comprised histone H2A ubiquitinated at K119, a modified histone that was subsequently shown by Levinger and Varshavsky3 to be associated with heterochromatin. At the same time as the discovery and characterization of ubiquitinated histone H2A, Hershko and Ciechanover embarked on their seminal work studying ATP-dependent protein degradation. Their first major discovery was the discovery of ATP-dependent proteolytic factor 1 (APF-1), a protein conjugated to other proteins marked for proteasomal degradation in rabbit reticulocytes4,5. APF-1 was quickly identified as ubiquitin by Wilkinson et. al6, linking two seemingly divergent functions of ubiquitin: chromatin compaction and protein degradation.
A few years following the discovery of ubiquitination, Hershko and Ciechanover followed up their work by successfully isolating the components of the ubiquitin-ligase system from reticulocytes in 19827. This allowed them to lay out the stepwise mechanism of ubiquitination by the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes and provided a clear biochemical framework for how the three enzymes coordinate with one another to conjugate ubiquitin to proteins. However, the first major glimpse into the now complex “ubiquitin code” came several years

later when Chau et al.8 revealed K48-linked polyubiquitin chains as the chain topology used to signal protein degradation8.
Expansion of the ubiquitin code: K63 and beyond
The next major landmark study ultimately changed forever the narrow view of the field regarding the role of ubiquitin as a marker for protein degradation. In 1999, Hofmann and Pickart9 explored how a K63R ubiquitin mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae conferred defects in DNA repair9, independent of ubiquitin’s function in proteasome degradation. Hypothesizing that K63 was a site of ubiquitin conjugation, Hofmann and Pickart surveyed the ubiquitination activity of various E2s in vitro. This led to their discovery of an E2 heterodimer complex consisting of the E2, Ubc13, and the catalytically inactive ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV), Mms2, as the complex that synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains10. This work paved the way for subsequent discoveries of the roles of other ubiquitin chain linkages, such as K6, K11, and K33. The molecular mechanism by which the ubiquitin enzyme machinery could generate chains of specific linkage types, though, was unknown.
Pickart’s discovery sparked our group’s venture into resolving the structural basis of K63 polyubiquitin chain assembly. Joining forces with Cecile Pickart’s group was serendipitous: a student in my lab, Andrew (Andy) VanDemark, was Cecile Pickart’s neighbor and learned about her discovery of Mms2/Ubc13 through casual conversation. In collaboration with Cecile’s group, Andy determined the crystal structure of Ubc13/Mms2, revealing the asymmetric heterodimer interface11. From that structure, we speculated that Mms2 served as a scaffold to position of K63 of the acceptor ubiquitin towards Ubc13’s active site cysteine. We were ultimately able to elucidate the role of Mms2 in K63 poly-ubiquitin chain formation and the biochemical principles guiding linkage specificity with our crystal structure of a Ubc13~ubiquitin conjugate bound to Mms2, which was published in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology12. We captured the covalent E2~Ub intermediate by substituting serine for the active site cysteine of Ubc13, which allowed us to generate the more stable ester intermediate state. To our surprise, the crystal packing of Mms2/ Ubc13~Ub revealed a clear mechanism of chain assembly; the ubiquitin of one Mms2/ Ubc13~Ub complex was bound to the acceptor binding site of Mms2 in a neighboring Ubc13-Mms2-Ub complex. Our crystal structure and mutagenesis data revealed that a hydrophobic residue in Mms2 engages with the I44 hydrophobic patch of the bound acceptor ubiquitin to specifically orient K63 towards the active site cysteine of Ubc13, ultimately providing the first structural insight into ubiquitin chain linkage specificity.
Histone ubiquitination in transcription and the DNA damage response
The finding that K63-linked polyubiquitin did not target substrates for degradation was part of a growing body of work pointing to other non-degradative roles for ubiquitin. Studies by Levinger and Varshavsky3 revealed that H2A-K119ub is associated with heterochromatin in Drosophila, but it had remained unclear whether the presence of H2A-K119ub played a functional role in gene silencing. The eventual identification of the E3 that ubiquitinates histone H2A revealed that the ubiquitination of H2A-K119 is necessary for gene silencing13, thereby establishing the foundation for delineating the Polycomb repression pathway14.

Adding a new layer of complexity to the ‘histone code’, Cooper et al. showed that ubiquitination of H2AK119 stimulates the PRC2 complex to methylate histone H3-K27 in an example of ‘histone crosstalk’, propagating H3K27 methylation across gene bodies and further reinforcing gene silencing15.
Other histone ubiquitination marks came to light revealing different non-degradative functions dependent on which histone and residue is modified. Such examples include histone H2B lysine 120 ubiquitination, which plays a role in transcription activation by promoting the methylation of H3K416 and H3K7917 by the MLL-1 complex and DOT1L, respectively. Another example is the ubiquitination of histone H2A-K15, which serves as a marker for DNA damage repair proteins such as 53BP118. Our group and others have shed light on the structural basis by which histone ubiquitination stimulates downstream modifications, revealing diverse mechanisms of cross-talk between ubiquitin and different chromatin-modifying complexes19–21. This work revealed a dual role for ubiquitin recognition in both recruiting factors and stimulating the catalytic activity of enzymes that recognize ubiquitin.
Beyond lysine ubiquitination
Cracks in the foundational understanding of ubiquitin as a covalent modifications of lysine side chains first appeared with the discovery of an E3 ligase complex, LUBAC, that synthesizes linear ubiquitin chains. Kazuhiro Iwai was studying the HOIL-1/HOIP E3 ligase complex, trying to determine what kind of polyubiquitin chains it synthesized. Systematic substitution of each of the seven ubiquitin lysines did not disrupt chain formation, leading to the unexpected finding that this E3 ligase complex covalently joined the C-terminus of one ubiquitin to the N-terminal α-amino group of another22. (A third LUBAC subunit, SHARPIN, was discovered subsequently.) Linear ubiquitin chains play a key role in the innate immune response by serving as a recruitment platform for downstream effectors23.
Whereas formation of a peptide instead of an isopeptide linkage seemed like a natural elaboration of the known ubiquitin conjugation chemistry, recent discoveries of quite unexpected chemical linkages has turned the classic paradigm on its head. The formation of oxyester linkages between the ubiquitin C-terminus and the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine was first found by accident through a transthiolation activity profiling assay of HECT/RBR E3 ligases carried out by the Virdee group24. They found that the neuron- associated E3 ligase, MYCBP2, contains two catalytic cysteines that conjugate ubiquitin to serine and threonine by a novel RING-Cys-relay mechanism. Remarkably, HOIL-1 can also catalyze ubiquitination of serine and threonine25. Even farther from the ubiquitin paradigm is the ubiquitin conjugation by the pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, which conjugates Arg42 of ubiquitin to a substrate serine via a phosphoribosyl linkage26! This noncanonical ubiquitination of host proteins disrupts cellular functions by altering their activity and localization.

Concluding remarks and outlook
Our understanding of the role ubiquitin plays in cell biology has evolved tremendously since the initial discovery that ubiquitination can target proteins for proteasomal degradation. We know far more now of the remarkable range of signaling roles played by ubiquitin in the DNA damage response, transcription regulation, innate immunity, and numerous other pathways, as well as how the host ubiquitin system is hijacked by pathogens. Each variation on the original ubiquitin theme that is discovered - be it atypical linkages, branched chains, or ubiquitination of non-protein substrates such as the lipopolysaccharides of an invading Salmonella bacterium27 – opens yet another area of investigation into how these modifications are assembled, recognized, removed, and mediate downstream processes. Ubiquitin’s simple structure has enabled it to serve as an essential building block of a remarkably complex array of biochemical signals and opened avenues to therapeutic design through the development of PROTACs and small-molecule inhibitors. Exciting basic and clinical research lies ahead.
