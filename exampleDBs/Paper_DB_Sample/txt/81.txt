ABSTRACT
Monoubiquitination of histone H2B at Lys123 in yeast plays a critical role in regulating transcription, mRNA export, DNA replication, and the DNA damage response. The RING E3 ligase, Bre1, catalyzes monoubiquitination of H2B in concert with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6. The crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of Bre1 shows that the catalytic RING domain is preceded by an N-terminal helix that mediates coiled-coil interactions with a crystallographically related monomer. Homology modeling suggests that the human homologue of Bre1, RNF20/RNF40, heterodimerizes through simi- lar coiled-coil interactions.

INTRODUCTION
The attachment of the 76-amino acid protein, ubiqui- tin, to substrate lysines regulates a vast array of biological processes. In addition to its well-known role in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation, ubiquitination plays nondegradative signaling roles in transcription regulation, endosomal sorting, and the DNA damage response. Ubiq- uitination of proteins initiates with the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin (Ub) by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), resulting in a thioester linkage between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the active site cysteine of E1. The activated ubiquitin is transferred to the active site cys- teine of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 in a transthiola- tion reaction, generating an E2;Ub conjugate.1 The E3 ligase binds to the E2;Ub conjugate as well as to the sub- strate and facilitates transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate, where ubiquitin is covalently linked to the E-amino group of lysine or, in some cases, to the protein N-terminus. E3 ligases function by two general mechanisms:2 they either serve as a catalytic intermediate in ubiquitination, as in terminus the case of homologous
(HECT)-type E3 ligases, or they mediate transfer of ubiqui- tin directly from the E2;Ub thioester to substrate, as in the case for really interesting new gene (RING)-type E3 ligases. Structural studies have shown that the RING domain binds to the E2 enzyme and positions the donor ubiquitin in the E2;Ub conjugate for ubiquitin transfer.3–5

finger protein 4),9 RNF8 10 and Rad18 11 dimerize through the core RING domain and, in some cases, through flanking regions located at either the N-terminus or C-terminus of the core RING motif. In some cases, dimerization is required for catalytic function: RNF4, for example, functions as an obligate dimer, and mutations that disrupt dimerization also disrupt E3 ligase activity.9 Some RING E3 ligases are heterodimers, such as BRCA1 (breast cancer-associated 1), which functions as a hetero- dimer with BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain 1).12 In this case, one RING domain (BARD1) lacks E3 ligase activity but is thought to stabilize the active E2- binding (BRCA1) RING domain.12
Bre1 from yeast and its human homologue, RNF20/40, are RING E3 ligases that catalyze monoubiquitination of histone H2B15,16 in conjunction with the E2 ubiquitin- conjugating enzyme, Rad6.17 Monoubiquitination of H2B-K123 in yeast (H2B-K120 in human cells )18 is enriched in highly transcribed regions, where it is required for subsequent methylation of histone H3-K4 19 and for recruiting the H2A/H2B chaperone, FACT, which facili- tates transcription through chromatin.20 H2B-K123/K120 monoubiquitination has also been implicated in regulating DNA replication,21 the DNA damage response22 and mRNA splicing.23 Yeast Bre1 forms a homodimer through intermolecular associations of both an N-terminal region (residues 1–110) and a C-terminal region (residues 450- 700).24 The RING domain of Bre1, located at the C-ter- for minus of mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B,14,15 as is the dime- rization region.24 To provide insights into Bre1 structure and dimerization, we carried out structural and solution studies of a fragment of a C-terminal fragment of yeast Bre1-spanning residues 591-700, which contains the RING domain and a predicted coiled-coil region.

OD600 nm of ;0.6, induced with 0.25 mM isopropyl-b- D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and grown overnight at 18 (cid:2)C before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM ZnCl2, 1 mM phe- nylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and 5–10 mM each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin protease inhibitors. The whole-cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was passed through a 5 mL HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) nickel affinity column pre- equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM ZnCl2, 20 mM imidaz- ole, and 0.1 mM PMSF. After washing the column with 25 column volumes of loading buffer, the protein was eluted with a gradient of loading buffer plus 1–1000 mM imidazole. The TRX-His6 tag was removed from the Bre1 RING by incubation with 1 mg of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease overnight during dialysis at 4 (cid:2)C against buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM ZnCl2, and 0.1 mM PMSF. Directly after the TRX-His6 tag cleavage with TEV protease, protein was purified with a HiTrap SP-XL cation-exchange col- umn (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) to remove the TRX- His6 and uncleaved tagged protein. The purified protein was concentrated to 21 mg/mL, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280 (cid:2)C until use.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Bre1 is a dimeric RING domain with an N- terminal coiled coil
The structure of a C-terminal fragment of Bre1 span- ning residues 632-700 and containing the RING domain was determined at 2.25 A˚ resolution. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Although the crystallized fragment also included residues 591-631, there is no corresponding electron density, indicating that this region is disordered. The Bre1 monomer con- tains a RING motif (residue 647-700) flanked by an N- terminal a-helix (a1) (Fig. 1A). Figure 1B shows residues 632-647 from N-terminal a-helix (a1) manually built

for activity.13 Although Bre1 crystallizes with one mono- mer in the asymmetric unit, a second monomer related by the crystallographic twofold axis gives rise to a Bre1 dimer with a total interface of 1031 A˚ 2 as calculated with PISA.33 The dimerization interface consists of symmetric interactions between the two RING domains and coiled- coil interactions between the N-terminal a-helices (a1), where Leu 635, Leu 639, Phe 642, Leu 645, Val 646, Tyr 647, Trp 655, and Leu 700 are involved in hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1C). Glu 638 and Arg 643 are in a position to form electrostatic interactions between opposing monomers given small adjustments to side- chain rotamers, suggesting that these residues may form a salt bridge in solution. To test whether the observed Bre1 crystallographic dimer reflects the solution state, we used size-exclusion chromatography and confirmed that Bre1 (591-700) migrates as an apparent dimer (Fig. 1D). By contrast, a mutant Bre1 protein containing a substitu- tion predicted to disrupt the dimer interface, Trp655 to arginine, migrates primarily as a monomer (Fig. 1D), with just a small amount migrating as the wild-type dimer.
Comparison with other RING domain proteins
Comparisons with other dimeric RING E3 ligases show that the Bre1 RING dimer most closely resembles cIAP2,8 which also contains an N-terminal helix [Figs. 2(A,B)]. The Bre1 RING dimer superimposes with the cIAP2 RING dimer with a root mean square difference (rmsd) of 1.3 A˚. The relative orientation of the respective RING domains and the N-terminal coiled-coil align quite well despite the lack of sequence conservation between Bre1 and cIAP2. By contrast, RING domains such as human Rad18 11 that dimerize via four-helix bundles are positioned differently as compared to Bre1 or cIAP2 (Fig. 2C), thus giving rise to a larger rmsd of 2.2 A˚ when the Bre1 and Rad18 RING dimers are superimposed. In Rad18, the RING domain is flanked by both N- and C- terminal helices that mediate dimerization with the heli- ces from an opposing monomer, forming a four-helix bundle (Fig. 2C). Intact Bre1 lacks a C-terminal helix, as the present structure (Fig. 1C) is of a Bre1 fragment that extends to the protein C-terminal residue, Leu 700, which is ordered and is part of the RING domain (Fig. 1A). The relation between RING domains in the Bre1 and cIAP2 dimers is surprisingly different from that in the different dimer Rad18 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that interfaces may govern the relation between RING domains in a given dimer.
RING fragment of Bre1 from the present study is 43% similar to analogous regions of both RNF20 and RNF40 (Fig. 2D). In particular, most of the residues involved in dimerization at the N-terminal a-helical region of Bre1 RING are identical or similar to the RNF20/40 residues (Fig. 2E). To compare the dimerization of the human RNF20/40 RING heterodimer with the yeast Bre1 homo- dimer, we generated a homology model using SWISS- MODEL.31 The Bre1 RING monomer was used as a template for each monomer, and the heterodimer inter- face was then generated based on the Bre1 homodimer (Fig. 2E). Overall, the RNF20/40 RING heterodimer pre- serves many of the key features of the Bre1 homodimer interface (Figs. 1D and 2E), including most of the hydro- phobic interactions and the salt bridge.
CONCLUSION
Bre1 is an E3 ligase enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevi- siae that catalyzes monoubiquitination of histone H2B and is similar to its human homolog, the RNF20/40 het- erodimer. Our structural study shows that a C-terminal fragment of yeast Bre1 RING forms a homodimer through symmetrical interaction medicated by N-termi- nus helices and RING core motif. This structure pro- vided studies suggesting that the human RNF20/40 RING E3 ligase forms a heterodimer similar to that of yeast Bre1. Our study provides the first step toward a structural under- standing of RING–RING interactions in yeast Bre1 and its human homologs.
