Summary
Triply mutated MAT(cid:1)2 protein, (cid:1)2-3A, in which all three major groove-contacting residues are mutated to alanine, is defective in binding DNA alone or in com- plex with Mcm1 yet binds with MATa1 with near wild- type affinity and specificity. To gain insight into this unexpectedbehavior,wedeterminedthecrystalstruc- ture of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex. The structure shows that the triple mutation causes a collapse of the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA interface that results in a reorganized set of (cid:1)2-3A/DNA contacts, thereby enabling the mu- tant protein to recognize the wild-type DNA sequence. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements reveal thatamuchmorefavorableentropiccomponentstabi- lizes the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex than the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex. The combined structural and thermody- namic studies provide an explanation of how partner proteins influence the sequence specificity of a DNA binding protein.
Introduction
MAT(cid:1)2 (which we shall call (cid:1)2) is a DNA binding protein that plays a central role in the regulation of mating type in the yeast S. cerevisiae [1]. In haploid (cid:1) cells, (cid:1)2 forms a heterotetramer with the Mcm1 protein that binds to regulatory sites upstream of a-specific genes, repress- ing their transcription [2]. In diploid a/(cid:1) cells, (cid:1)2 binds DNA cooperatively with the a1 homeodomain protein, leading to the repression of haploid-specific genes [1]. The 210-residue (cid:1)2 protein contains two domains sepa- rated by a flexible linker [3]. The amino-terminal 100- residue domain is required for repression and interacts with the Tup1 component of the Tup1/Ssn6 corepressor complex[4,5],whilea63-residueTALE-class[6]homeo- domain near the carboxyl terminus binds DNA. The co- operative binding of (cid:1)2 and a1 depends on the 21- residue tail of (cid:1)2 (residues 190–210), located immedi- ately C-terminal to the homeodomain [7, 8].
homeodomain bound to DNA, the a1/(cid:1)2 heterodimer bound to DNA, and the (cid:1)2/MCM1 heterotetramer bound to DNA [9–11]. The DNA binding domain of (cid:1)2 adopts a typical homeodomain fold [11–16], with a compact three-helix globular domain that contacts major groove bases and the DNA backbone, mainly through the third helix, and an extended N-terminal arm that inserts into the DNA minor groove. The contacts between (cid:1)2 and DNA are nearly identical in all three crystal structures. The (cid:1)2 protein contacts four base pairs in the DNA major groove using three side chains in helix 3: Ser50, Asn51, and Arg54 (Figures 1A and 1C). Ser50 forms two water- mediated hydrogen bonds with A4 and T5, Arg54 con- tacts G6 with two direct hydrogen bonds, and Asn51 formsbidentate hydrogenbondswithA38. Asn51,which is an invariant homeodomain residue, forms identical contacts in other homeodomain-DNA structures [11– 16]. Additional side chains in helix 3 of (cid:1)2 make DNA phosphate backbone contacts, which help to position the recognition helix of (cid:1)2 in the DNA major groove. In structures of (cid:1)2 alone bound to DNA [11] and of the a1/ (cid:1)2 heterodimer bound to DNA [10], the N-terminal arm of (cid:1)2 forms additional interactions in the DNA minor groove, contacting a total of five base pairs with the side chains Arg4, Gly5, and Arg7. In contrast with the relative conservation of base contacts, the overall DNA conformation varies among the three structures con- taining(cid:1)2.NearlystraightB-DNAisfoundinthecomplex of (cid:1)2 alone bound to DNA [11], while the DNA in the a1/ (cid:1)2/DNA complex contains an overall bend of 60(cid:2), which is distributed smoothly, without dramatic distortion or kinking of the DNA helix [10]. The Mcm1 dimer imposes a local 72(cid:2) bend in the (cid:1)2/Mcm1/DNA complex [9].
The relative contribution of side chain contacts to (cid:1)2- DNA binding was examined by mutating DNA-con- tacting residues of the (cid:1)2 protein and assaying their effect on DNA binding in vivo and in vitro [17]. As ex- pected, changes in the amino acid residues that contact major groove DNA bases severely compromised the ability of (cid:1)2 to bind DNA alone or in complex with Mcm1. By contrast, many of these same mutations, including a triple alanine substitution ((cid:1)2-3A) that altered all of the DNA major groove recognition residues (Ser50, Asn51, and Arg54) (Figure 1C) had little or no effect on the cooperative binding of (cid:1)2 and a1 to specific DNA sequences [17]. Even more surprisingly, the (cid:1)2-3A mu- tant protein, when binding DNA as a heterodimer with a1, retains its ability to discriminate among different DNA sequences [18].
In order to understand the paradoxical context- dependent DNA binding behavior of the (cid:1)2-3A protein, we have determined the crystal structure of the a1/(cid:1)2- 3A heterodimer bound to DNA. We find that the triple alanine mutation induces a collapse of the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA interface,givingrisetoanewsetofinteractionsbetween (cid:1)2-3A and the DNA bases that help account for the wild-

We show that Asn47, which is not required for DNA binding in the wild-type (cid:1)2 pro- tein,hasa criticalroleinthecontextof the(cid:1)2-3Amutant. We also investigated how the presence of a1 stabilizes the binding of (cid:1)2-3A to DNA by carrying out thermody- namic measurements of the DNA binding of wild-type and mutant (cid:1)2 in the presence or absence of a1. The results show that when the (cid:1)2-3A protein binds DNA as a heterodimer with a1, a large favorable entropic change rescues the enthalpy loss, resulting in a mere 4-fold decrease in the affinity of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer for DNA as compared to that of the wild-type heterodimer. In the absence of a1, the entropic change does not compensate for the enthalpy loss, resulting in an 86-fold decrease in the affinity of (cid:1)2-3A for DNA as compared to that of the wild-type protein. We discuss the possible sources of these striking energetic differences between the DNA binding of the triple mutant (cid:1)2-3A alone and that of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer.
Results
Structure Determination The a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA ternary complex crystals were ob- tained with a 20-base pair DNA oligonucleotide (Figure 1B), which is one base pair shorter than the DNA frag- ment used in the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA structure deter- mination [10]. Since the DNA in the crystal stacks end toend, theone-basepairdifference changestheangular relationship between stacked complexes. The conse- quence is a space group change from the right-handed

The a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex crystals diffract somewhat anisotropically, to a maximum resolution of 2.3 A˚ along the a and b axes and to 2.5 A˚ along the c axis. The a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure was solved by molecular replacement in AmoRe [19] using the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/ DNA structure (Protein Data Bank code 1AKH) as the search model. The model was refined with CNS [20] to a final R factor of 25.8% and an Rfree of 29.8% at 2.3 A˚ resolution (Table 1). Both R and Rfree factors are compa- rable to those of the wild-type complex structure. They are at the high end presumably because of the static disorder inherent in the crystals. The model of the a1/ (cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex contains residues 132–205 of the (cid:1)2-3A protein and residues 74–126 of the a1 protein. To facilitate the comparison between our findings and those of previous homeodomain structural studies, the amino acid residues of the a1 and (cid:1)2-3A homeodomain were renumbered from 0 to 60 according to the homeo- domain numbering convention [11–16]. Residues 131– 151 of (cid:1)2-3A correspond to homeodomain residues 3– 23, and residues 155–190 of (cid:1)2-3A correspond to homeodomain residues 24–59. Residues 152–154 of (cid:1)2- 3A, a three-residue insertion relative to other homeodo- mains, are labeled a, b, and c. The a1 residues 74–126 have been renumbered 5–57.
Overview The overall structure of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex is similar to that of the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA complex (Fig- ure 2A). As was found previously, the a1 and (cid:1)2-3A

A nearly identical DNA bend is observed in both the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA and a1/(cid:1)2/DNA structures, even though the DNA in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure is one base pair shorter than in the original structure, the space group is P65, rather than P61, and the pitch of the superhelix formed by stacked DNA complexes is 164.2 A˚ , versus 45.71 A˚ in the wild-type structure. Taken together, this suggests that the observed bend is imposed by the a1 and(cid:1)2proteins,notbytheconstraintsofcrystalpacking and symmetry. Model building shows that removal of one base pair from the DNA end in the original structure would change the handedness of the 6-fold DNA su- perhelix from the right-handed superhelix in the wild- type structure to the left-handed superhelix in the pres- ent structure. Although the DNA models from the two structures superimpose fairly well, with an rmsd of 1.2 A˚ local for phosphorus atoms, changes in the (cid:1)2 half of the site that have important consequences for protein-DNA interactions, as dis- cussed below.

homeodomains bind in tandem to one face of the DNA, inducing a fairly smooth 60(cid:2) bend. The tail of (cid:1)2-3A folds into an amphipathic helix that binds to a hydrophobic patch located between helices 1 and 2 of the a1 homeo- domain. The core homeodomain residues of a1 and (cid:1)2- 3A superimpose with their wild-type counterparts with root-mean-square differences (rmsd) of 0.36 A˚ and 0.40 A˚ , respectively, in C(cid:1) positions.

a1-DNA Interface The contacts between a1 and the DNA are not affected by the rearrangement at the interface of the adjacent (cid:1)2- 3A protein. The core homeodomain of a1 in the mutant structure aligns quite well with that in the wild-type structure, with an rmsd in C(cid:1) positions (residues 13–56) of only 0.36 A˚ . Moreover, there is little displacement in DNA base positions within the a1 binding site. The key DNA major groove-contacting residues (Val47, Ile50, Asn51, Met 54, and Arg55) adopt the same conforma-

The two structures were aligned by performing a least-squares superposition of both a1 and (cid:1)2 proteins in both structures. The a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure is shown in blue and the structure of the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA complex is shown in silver. A similar 60(cid:2) bend in DNA is present in both structures.

tions in both mutant and wild-type structures and make the same contacts with the DNA. The positions of the water molecules found at the a1-DNA interface in the wild-type structure are also conserved in the mutant structure, and no new water molecules are found at the interface. As was found in the original structure con- taining wild-type (cid:1)2, the N-terminal arm of a1 does not contact the DNA minor groove, even though three addi- tional N-terminal arm residues are ordered in the a1/(cid:1)2- 3A/DNA structure. All sugar-phosphate backbone con- tacts between a1 and the DNA are essentially the same in both structures.
The (cid:1)2-3A-DNA Interface Contains a Reorganized Set of Contacts The most notable difference between the wild-type and mutant structures occurs where helix 3 of (cid:1)2 inserts into the DNA major groove. The substitution of the Ser50, Asn51, and Arg54 side chains with shorter alanine side chains in (cid:1)2-3A results in an inward collapse of the DNA base pairs at the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA interface to fill the resulting void. Several base pairs at the interface of (cid:1)2 and DNA move an average of 0.5 A˚ –1.0 A˚ closer to the protein (Figure 2B). For example, C39 shifts 0.5 A˚ along the DNA helical axis and 1 A˚ inward toward (cid:1)2-3A to accommo- date the side chain substitutions. The net result of these changes is a reorganized set of (cid:1)2-DNA interactions in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure (Figure 3C). Sugar-phos- phate contacts mediated by Trp48, Arg53, Lys55, and Lys57 in Helix 3 of (cid:1)2 maintain the position of (cid:1)2 relative to the DNA major groove and are absolutely conserved in both the wild-type and the mutant structures.
TheinwardcollapseoftheDNAbasesinthea1/(cid:1)2-3A/ DNA complex gives rise to a new set of direct contacts between helix 3 of (cid:1)2-3A and the DNA bases, which are summarized in Figure 3D. The DNA base pairs from T4 to A8 that wild-type (cid:1)2 specifies by side chain interac- tions in themajor groove now formreorganized contacts with (cid:1)2-3A in the mutant structure. The C39 base shifts 0.5 A˚ along the DNA axis and moves 1.0 A˚ closer to (cid:1)2- 3A in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure, making possible a new direct hydrogen bond (3.12 A˚ ) between Asn47 and the N4 of C39 (Figures 3C and 3D). In the wild-type a1/ (cid:1)2/DNA structure, Asn47 is 4 A˚ from C39 and, therefore, too far away to make any base contacts. The empty space left by substituting Ser50 and Arg54 with alanines in the (cid:1)2-3A protein also allows T5 to move inward toward the (cid:1)2 protein, giving rise to new van der Waals interactions with residues 50 and 54 (Figures 3C and 3D). The distance between the C(cid:10) of Ala50 and the C5 methyl group of T5 is shortened from 5.48 A˚ in the wild- typestructureto3.97A˚ inthemutantstructure.Similarly, the distance between the C(cid:10) of Ala54 of (cid:1)2-3A and the T5 methyl in the wild-type structure to 3.99 A˚ in the mutant structure. By substitut- ing the hydrophilic Asn51 side chain in the wild-type (cid:1)2 protein with a hydrophobic alanine side chain, a hy- drophobic interaction is created between the methyl of T37 and the C(cid:10) of Ala51 (3.74 A˚ ) (Figures 3C and 3D). The distance between the same pair of atoms in the wild-type structure is 4.03 A˚ .
is shortened from 4.29 A˚
An extensive water network fills the remaining empty
space left by the alanine substitutions at the (cid:1)2-3A-DNA interface. A total of seven ordered water molecules, well connected by hydrogen bonds, are found at the inter- face between (cid:1)2-3A and the DNA in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure. In contrast, there are only four ordered water molecules found at the interface between (cid:1)2 and the DNA in the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA structure. Interestingly, none of the water positions in the wild-type structure are conserved in the mutant structure. The water network in the present structure starts by hydrogen bonding to the N(cid:9)H2, O(cid:9), and backbone oxygen of Asn47 and then zigzags along the midline of the base pairs in the major groove, makes hydrogen bonds to T5, C39, G6, and T7, and ends in hydrogen bond contacts with the backbone oxygen atoms of Ala51 and Ala54 (Figures 3C and 3D). Most waters in the structure are highly coordinated; of the seven waters found in our structure, two of them are fully hydrogen bonded, and two other waters form three hydrogen bonds each.
The N-terminal arm of (cid:1)2-3A does not insert as deeply into the DNA minor groove as in the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/ DNA structure. It is possible that this difference may be due to the crystal-packing contacts in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/ DNA crystal. A symmetry-related complex abuts the DNA backbone in the vicinity of the (cid:1)2 N-terminal arm and may cause the observed widening of the DNA minor groove that is contacted by the tail of (cid:1)2 in the wild- type structure. Moreover, adoption of the (cid:1)2 N-terminal arm conformation found in the wild-type structure would create severe steric clashes with the DNA backbone of the symmetry-related complex in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure. The arm of the (cid:1)2-3A protein appears to avoid this clash by adopting an extended conformation from residue 3 to 6, extending toward the DNA minor groove of the symmetry-related DNA molecule. The electron density for this region is rather poor, and the atomic B factors are high, indicating a low degree of order. Residues0–2ofthe(cid:1)2-3A N-terminalarmhavenocorre- sponding density in the electron density map. Arg7 of (cid:1)2-3A adopts the same conformation as in the wild-type structure, but the DNA base is shifted, such that it only makes two weak hydrogen bonds with O2 of T35 (3.4 A˚ ) and N3 of A10 (3.35 A˚ ). None of the other minor groove contacts are preserved in the mutant structure. How- ever, it is found that a minor groove contact mutation (Arg4 to Ala) almost completely destabilizes the a1/(cid:1)2- 3A/DNA complex, while having little effect on the wild- type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA complex (data not shown). This sug- gests that the minor groove contacts by the N-terminal arm of (cid:1)2-3A are likely still present and may even make a greater contribution to DNA binding affinity than in the wild-type complex.
The observeddirect andwater-mediated contactsbe- tween (cid:1)2-3A and bases in the DNA major groove help explain the in vivo and in vitro assay results, which sug- gest that (cid:1)2-3A retains the DNA sequence preference of wild-type (cid:1)2 when binding DNA in complex with a1. Base substitution analysis showed that DNA bases T5, G6, and T7, which are strongly selected for by the wild- type (cid:1)2 protein because of base-specific contacts, are also preferred by (cid:1)2-3A in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex [18]. Substitution of T5 with A or G results in a compara- ble 5-fold reduction of DNA binding affinity for both

(C) Stereo view of the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA interface showing reorganized major groove contacts in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure. All three alanines substituted for Ser50, Asn51, and Arg54 are able to make van der Waals contacts to thymine bases. Asn47, which was too far away from any base in the wild-type structure, forms a direct hydrogen bond to C39. A highly coordinated water network occupies the void left by the alanine substitutions mediating contacts between Asn47 and Ala51 of (cid:1)2-3A and DNA bases including T5, G6, T7, T37, C39, and A40.

the wild-type and the mutant a1/(cid:1)2 heterodimer. The present structure shows that the methyl of T5 is in van der Waals contacts with Ala50 and Ala54, so any other base at this position could not duplicate this interaction due to the lack of the protruding methyl group. The binding of both the wild-type and the mutant a1/(cid:1)2 het- erodimer to G6A- or G6C-substituted DNA is 50-fold weaker. Wild-type (cid:1)2 makes two hydrogen bonds with G6 using Arg54, whereas (cid:1)2-3A uses Asn47 to contact C39 as a result of the collapse of the DNA toward the protein in the mutant structure. T7G and T7A substitu- tions result in reduction of the DNA binding affinity of both the wild-type and the mutant a1/(cid:1)2 heterodimer. InsteadoftheAsn51-A38contactsfoundinthewild-type structure, a water-mediated hydrogen bond contact is found in the major groove of the mutant structure. Since a mutation in the N-terminal arm (Arg4Ala) decreases the affinity of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer for DNA, it is likely that minor groove contacts between Arg4 and A38
also contributes to the specificity of (cid:1)2-3A at the T7- A38 base pair region (data not shown).
Besidesthebasepaircollapseinthe(cid:1)2-3A/DNAinter- face, there are distributed differences in DNA structure in the intervening base pairs between the a1 and (cid:1)2 sites, with several base pairs shifted along the DNA helical axis by as much as 1 A˚ . The conformational changes in this region, as well as the changes in the (cid:1)2 binding site, appear to be the result of the DNA adjusting itself to maximize the number of favorable contacts with (cid:1)2-3A.
Side Chain Substitution that Selectively Affects a1/(cid:1)2-3A Binding to DNA Comparison of the (cid:1)2-DNA contacts in the wild-type and (cid:1)2-3A mutant a1/(cid:1)2/DNA structures predicts that Asn47 of (cid:1)2 contributes more to the DNA binding affinity of the mutant complex than to the wild-type complex.

type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA structure but makes a direct hydrogen bond contact to C39 of the DNA major groove in the a1/ (cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure. To test this prediction, we exam- ined the ability of wild-type (cid:1)2 and (cid:1)2-3A proteins bear- ing an Asn47 to Ala mutation to repress a promoter containing an a1/(cid:1)2 binding site. The mutant (cid:1)2 proteins were expressed in yeast from MAT(cid:1) loci carried on a CEN plasmid, and a1 was supplied from the chromo- somal MATa loci (Figure 4A). The effect of the (cid:1)2 muta- tions on a1/(cid:1)2-mediated repression was assayed using an integrated lacZ reporter containing an a1/(cid:1)2 binding site. Both wild-type and triply mutated (cid:1)2 repress the reporter gene to a similar extent (Figure 4B). As shown previously [17], mutation of Asn47 to alanine has little or no effect on a1/(cid:1)2-mediated repression (Figure 4B), which is in agreement with the observation that Asn47 does notdirectly contactthe DNAin thecrystal structure of the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA complex. However, when introduced into the (cid:1)2-3A protein, the Asn47Ala muta- tion almost completely derepresses the reporter gene promoter (Figure 4B). All mutant and wild-type proteins are expressed at a similar level, as verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown). These results support
the observation from the crystal structure that the Asn47 side chain contacts DNA in the context of the (cid:1)2-3A mutant, but not in the wild-type complex.
Thermodynamic Studies of the (cid:1)2-3A-DNA Interaction The reorganized interface between the triply mutated (cid:1)2 protein and the DNA in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure reveals new protein-DNA contacts that could potentially explain why substitution of alanine for these base-con- tacting residues in (cid:1)2 has a relatively minimal effect on the sequence-specific DNA binding affinity of the a1/(cid:1)2 heterodimer. The observed new set of contacts at the interface of (cid:1)2-3A and DNA are mostly van der Waals interactions and water-mediated contacts, whose ther- modynamic profile is expected to be quite different from that of the mostly hydrogen bond contacts found at the interface of wild-type (cid:1)2 and DNA. We carried out thermodynamic measurements to compare the ener- getic differences between the binding of a1/(cid:1)2-3A and a1/(cid:1)2 to DNA. The thermodynamic parameters of the DNA binding of the (cid:1)2-3A or wild-type (cid:1)2 protein alone were also compared in order to address the question of why the triple alanine substitution in (cid:1)2 has a large negative effect on the DNA binding of (cid:1)2 alone but little effect when a1 is present.
Isothermaltitration calorimetry(ITC)wasused tomea- sure the enthalpy ((cid:11)H), entropy ((cid:11)S), and free energy ((cid:11)G) of the binding of both (cid:1)2-3A and wild-type (cid:1)2 to DNA in the presence or absence of a1. The reaction stoichiometry, dissociation constant (Kd), and enthalpy change of the DNA binding reaction were directly mea- sured in an ITC experiment. The free energy and entropy changes of the DNA binding reaction were then directly calculated from thermodynamic equations ((cid:11)G (cid:4) (cid:6)RTlnKeq; (cid:11)G (cid:4) (cid:11)H (cid:6) T(cid:11)S). Typical experimental data are shown in Figure 5. The results from all ITC experi- ments are summarized in Table 2.
In the first set of experiments, equimolar amounts of a1 and either (cid:1)2 or (cid:1)2-3A proteins were premixed. Either the a1/(cid:1)2 or a1/(cid:1)2-3A complex was then titrated into a solution containing a 23-base pair DNA oligonucleotide containing the same a1/(cid:1)2 binding sequence used in the structural analysis. Both binding reactions can be characterized as strongly exothermic (large negative (cid:11)H). There is an 8.2 kcal/mol reduction in the (cid:11)H release upon binding of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer to DNA as compared with the wild-type (cid:1)2. This was not surprising inlightof thelossofmultiple hydrogenbondinteractions due to the alanine substitutions in (cid:1)2-3A. However, the large unfavorable (cid:11)H change for the mutant is largely compensated by a 7.4 kcal/mol favorable T(cid:11)S change. The total free energy loss for the binding of a1/(cid:1)2-3A to DNA is only 0.8 kcal/mol as compared to the wild- type, corresponding to a mere 3.9-fold decrease in dis- sociation constant.
Very different thermodynamic parameters were ob- served when (cid:1)2, as opposed to (cid:1)2-3A, was titrated into a solution containing the same DNA fragment in the absence of a1. Both mutant and wild-type (cid:1)2 proteins bind to this DNA oligonucleotide with a stoichiometry of 2:1. This is consistent with the finding in electrophoretic

mobility shift assays (EMSAs) that both 2:1 and 1:1 com- plexes of (cid:1)2/DNA are observed on the gel, even when the (cid:1)2 protein concentration is as low as 10(cid:6)8 M (data not shown). Binding of the second (cid:1)2 protein is due to the presence within the a1 site of a suboptimal (cid:1)2 bind- ing site containing the TGTA sequence, which is highly preferred by (cid:1)2. The values obtained for the (cid:11)H and (cid:11)G of binding of the wild-type (cid:1)2 protein to DNA are comparable to those obtained in an independent experi- ment using differential scanning calorimetry [21]. Bind- ing of (cid:1)2-3A to DNA generates much less heat than does the binding of the wild-type protein to DNA ((cid:11)H is 6.1 kcal/mol). In the absence of a1, the entropy term (T(cid:11)S) only partly compensates for the enthalpy differ- ence (3.5 kcal/mol). The net result is an unfavorable free energy change of 2.6 kcal/mol when the DNA binding of (cid:1)2-3A is compared to the wild-type. This corresponds to an 83-fold decrease in dissociation constant, from 5.4 (cid:13) 10(cid:6)8 M for wild-type (cid:1)2 to 4.4 (cid:13) 10(cid:6)6 M for the triple alanine mutant.
The Kd and free energy data obtained from these two sets of ITC data in part verify the previous in vivo and

in vitro results showing that the DNA binding affinity of (cid:1)2-3A and (cid:1)2-3A/Mcm1 is reduced dramatically by the triple alanine substitutions in (cid:1)2, whereas the affinity of a1/(cid:1)2-3A for DNA is comparable to that of the wild-type heterodimer.Moreimportantly,the(cid:11)HandT(cid:11)Schanges observed in the two sets of ITC experiments reveal that the enthalpy release as compared to the wild-type pro- tein is less when (cid:1)2-3A binds DNA either in the presence or absence of a1. The decreased enthalpy release is very well compensated by a favorable entropic change where the mutant (cid:1)2 protein binds as a heterodimer with a1 but is poorly compensated by entropy change when (cid:1)2-3A binds DNA in the absence of a1.

homeodomain showed many similarities with the ho- meodomains from higher eukaryotes [9, 10, 11, 17, 18]. However, the context-dependent DNA binding behavior of the (cid:1)2-3A mutant raised a paradox: with all three major groove-contacting residues mutated to alanine, (cid:1)2-3A binds DNA poorly by itself or in complex with Mcm1 yet binds with wild-type affinity to DNA in com- plex with a1. The a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer even has DNA sequence selectivity similar to that of the wild-type het- erodimer. In this paper, we have delved into the source of the unexpected behavior of this mutant (cid:1)2 protein.
Specificity of the (cid:1)2-3A-DNA Interactions in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A /DNA Structure The structure of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer bound to DNA showed that mutating Ser50, Asn51, and Arg54 to shorter alanine side chains allows the DNA bases to collapse inward toward the (cid:1)2-3A protein, which, in turn, allows a reorganized set of protein/DNA contacts to form in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure. As a result, base pairs T5–A8, formerly contacted by the three wild-type side chains, are specified by a new set of contacts in the mutant structure. The new contacts seem to confer enough specificity for the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer to pre- fer the wild-type DNA sequence. All three alanine substi- tutions make van der Waals contacts with the methyl group of thymines, which are closer to the protein in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA ternary complex. T5 is contacted by Ala50 and Ala54, whereas T8 is in contact with Ala51. None of the other three DNA bases in the position of either of these thymines can mediate comparable van der Waals interactions, since they lack the protruding methyl group. Recognition of the G6-C39 base pair, which is specified by the Arg54-G6 contact in the wild- type structure, is achieved by Asn47, which contacts C39 in the mutant structure. This contact becomes pos- sible in the mutant complex due to the movement of C39 1 A˚ closer to Asn47. The structural observation is supported by functional assays showing that mutating Asn47 to alanine has a much larger negative effect on a1/(cid:1)2-mediated repression by the a1/(cid:1)2-3A hetero- dimer than the wild-type.The hydrogen bonding geome- try of the Asn47-C39 contact predicts that a cytosine would be favored over either adenine or guanine. A thy- mine at position 39 is likely to be unfavorable, since the protruding methyl of thymine would cause severe steric clashes. These predictions are supported by the obser- vation that base pair substitutions at this position of the a1/(cid:1)2 site significantly reduce the ability of the (cid:1)2-3A mutant to repress transcription in vivo or bind to the site in vitro [18].
In contrast with the above examples, in which new side chain-base contacts are formed by the mutant (cid:1)2 protein, the T7-A38 base pair forms only a water-medi- ated contact with (cid:1)2-3A in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure. The water network at the interface of (cid:1)2-3A and DNA is fairly rigid and potentially provides more specificity than loosely bound waters. The minor groove contacts by (cid:1)2-3A may also help to specify this base pair, since the N-terminal arm mutations disrupting minor groove contacts almost completely abolishes the a1/(cid:1)2-medi- ated repression by the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer (data not
shown) but has little effect on the repression function of the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2 heterodimer [17].
Role of Solvent in Mediating (cid:1)2-3A-DNA Interactions The interface between (cid:1)2-3A and DNA contains a much larger water network than that seen in the wild-type complex. Although some of the waters appear to serve as filler at the protein/DNA interface, many waters medi- ate hydrogen bond contacts between (cid:1)2-3A and DNA. Four DNA bases, T5, C39, G6, and T7, are contacted by water-mediated hydrogen bonds. How much the water- mediated contacts contribute to the (cid:1)2-3A binding specificity is an open question. Since water has two donors and two acceptors, a bridge contact containing just two hydrogen bonds with the water will not be spe- cific, since the water can potentially rotate to present either a donor or acceptor to the base. Specificity can potentially only arise when the water makes more than two hydrogen bonds simultaneously [25]. Of the seven waters found in our structure, two—contacting T5 and C39—form four hydrogen bonds each. Another two wa- ters contacting G6 each form three hydrogen bonds. These highly coordinated water molecules participate in a fairly rigid water network that can contribute much more to specificity than a comparable number of seven loosely bound waters observed in the wild-type complex.
Thermodynamic Characterization of (cid:1)2-3A Alone and the a1/(cid:1)2-3A Heterodimer Ourthermodynamicmeasurementsindicatethatthedis- sociation constant (Kd) of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer drops only 3.9-fold as compared to that of wild-type a1/ (cid:1)2, which is consistent with previous studies [17, 18]. However, the enthalpy-entropy balance of the binding process is dramatically different for the mutant. The enthalpy of the binding of a1/(cid:1)2-3A to DNA ((cid:6)13.7 kcal/ mol) is only 62% of that of the wild-type. At the same time, the entropic component (T(cid:11)S) of the DNA binding of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer increases dramatically from (cid:6)6.43 kcal/mol for the wild-type to 0.97 kcal/mol. A remarkable 90% of the unfavorable enthalpy change in the case of the mutant is compensated by a more favorable entropic component. As will be discussed be- low, this trend is in agreement with the predicted ener- getic effect of the reorganized contacts observed at the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA interface in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA structure. A similar 60% drop in the enthalpy release is found in the binding of (cid:1)2-3A alone to DNA as compared to the wild- type. However, only 58% of the lost enthalpy release is compensated by the favorable entropic changes in the case of the mutant alone, with the result that the Kd of (cid:1)2-3A alone binding to DNA drops 85-fold as compared to the wild-type.
The reorganized protein/DNA contacts at the (cid:1)2-3A/ DNA interface are the major structural differences be- tween thea1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA andthe wild-typeternary com- plex, and their predicted energetic effects are in agree- ment with our thermodynamic measurements. The alanine substitutions in the a2-3A mutant changed the nature of the (cid:1)2/DNA major groove interaction, from

mostlyhydrogenbondinteractionsinthewild-typecom- plex to mostly hydrophobic interactions in the mutant. As reflected in the thermodynamic parameters, this means that the binding of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer to DNA is less enthalpically favorable but more entropically favorable when compared to that of the wild-type. It is estimated that losing each hydrogen bond accounts for an (cid:1)1–3 kcal/mol decrease in enthalpy release [26]. The three alanine substitutions disrupt a total of four direct hydrogen bonds, while only one new hydrogen bond is gained at the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA interface. This likely accounts for most of the enthalpy loss when the DNA binding of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer is compared with that of wild-type.
The more favorable entropic term for the DNA binding of the a1/(cid:1)2-3A heterodimer comes from several poten- tial sources. To make enthalpically favorable hydrogen bonds with DNA bases, Ser50, Asn51, and Arg54 must lose most of their side chain conformational entropy, which ranges from 2.3 kcal/mol for Arg to 0.8 kcal/mol for Ser [27]. The total side chain conformational entropy loss is about 4 kcal/mol for the wild-type (cid:1)2 protein. (cid:1)2-3A, by contrast, pays little conformational entropy penalty, since the alanine side chain adopts only one conformation. The hydration process also adds to the equation. Waters are excluded from the protein-DNA interface when protein and DNA form a stable complex. Whether this dehydration process is entropically favor- able depends on the typesof protein side chains that are dehydrated at the protein/DNA interface. Dehydration of aliphatic side chains, such as alanine, in (cid:1)2-3A is entropically favorable, whereas dehydration of polar groups, such as Ser, Asn, and Arg, in the wild-type (cid:1)2 is entropically unfavorable. While an increased number of immobilized waters mediate (cid:1)2-3A/DNA contacts in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex, immobilizing waters is not as entropically costly as freezing side chain mobility.
The lack of a favorable entropy compensation when the mutant (cid:1)2-3A binds DNA on its own suggests that the reorganized set of interactions seen in the a1/(cid:1)2- 3A/DNA ternary complex may be missing from the (cid:1)2- 3A/DNA complex. All the reorganized contacts in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA ternary complex form only after the base collapse at the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA interface. If such an inward collapse were not to occur when (cid:1)2-3A alone binds DNA, some (cid:1)2-3A-DNA interactions, especially those van der Waals interactions that are very sensitive to distance, would not be formed. Alternatively, it is possi- ble that the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA ternary complex may gain entropic advantage by being more flexible than the wild- type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA ternary complex. As the interaction be- tween (cid:1)2-3A and DNA weakens, the highly bent DNA imposed by the a1/(cid:1)2 heterodimer may become more flexible, especially at the intervening sequence between the a1 and (cid:1)2-3A sites. The entropic advantage achieved this way cannot be utilized by the (cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex. The above explanations may account for the large negative effect of the triple alanine mutation on the DNA binding of the (cid:1)2-3A/Mcm1 heterotetramer. In the (cid:1)2/Mcm1/DNA structure, the (cid:1)2-DNA interface is perpendicular to a 72(cid:2) DNA bend induced locally by the binding of the Mcm1 dimer [9]. DNA base collapse toward (cid:1)2-3A is less likely to happen in this complex,
since it is perpendicular to the direction of the molecular strain in the DNA. It is also possible that the (cid:1)2/Mcm1/ DNA complex may be a flexible complex to begin with and cannot gain additional flexibility due to mutation at the (cid:1)2-DNA interface. This is supported by the structural observation that interactions between (cid:1)2 and Mcm1 are mediated by a flexible eight-amino acid N-terminal sequence of (cid:1)2 that adopts either an (cid:1)-helical or a (cid:10) strand conformation [9].
Biological Implications
The ability of a cell to modulate transcription of specific genes is dependent upon proteins that bind preferen- tially to specific DNA sequences. In the great majority of proteins, side chain contacts with bases in the major groove play a dominant role in determining sequence specificity.Interactionswithpartnerproteinssometimes play a role in modulating a protein’s intrinsic sequence specificity, although these effects are typically modest. In the case of the yeast MAT(cid:1)2 homeodomain protein, however, mutation of major groove-contacting residues has a dramatic context-dependent effect: a triply mu- tated (cid:1)2 protein binds DNA poorly on its own, but with near-wild-type affinity when bound to DNA coopera- tively with the MATa1 homeodomain protein. In this study, we use structural and thermodynamic ap- proaches to understand how interactions with a partner protein can alter the sensitivity to mutations of a DNA binding protein’s activity.
In the structure of the triple mutant (cid:1)2-3A bound to DNA as a heterodimer with the MATa1 protein, we ob- serve a collapse of the (cid:1)2-3A interface, due to the triple mutation, that results in a reorganized set of contacts between (cid:1)2-3A and DNA. This attests to the ability of the mutant protein to bind to, and recognize, DNA when binding as a complex with a1. Isothermal titration calo- rimetry measurements show that the triple mutation yields similar enthalpic losses when (cid:1)2-3A binds DNA either on its own or in complex with MATa1. However, there is significant favorable entropy compensation only when the mutant (cid:1)2-3A protein binds DNA together with MATa1. We provide possible explanations for the en- tropy gain upon ternary complex formation.
Experimental Procedures
Crystallization and Data Collection and Structure Determination A fragment of the a1 C-terminal DNA binding domain (residues 74–126) was synthesized by standard solid-state peptide synthesis methodusinga MilliGen9050PepSynthesizerwith FMOCchemistry. The peptide was purified by reverse-phase chromatography C4 fol- lowed by C18 column. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrome- try confirmed the purity to be (cid:1)99%.
Both the wild-type (wt) and the triple alanine mutant (3A) of (cid:1)2 protein (residues 128–210) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to (cid:8)99% homogeneity by cation exchange (SP Sepha- rose) and reverse phase (C4) chromatography.
Oligonucleotides for crystallization were synthesized by the phos- phoramidite method on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were purified twice over a Dyna- max PureDNA column (Varian) with acetonitrile gradient. The trityl group was cleaved prior to the second gradient with 0.5% TFA. Equimolar amounts of two complementary DNA strands were an- nealed, lyophilized, and stored at (cid:6)80(cid:2)C.
Structure 970
The a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA complex was formed by mixing (cid:1)2-3A (resi- dues 128–210) and a1 (residues 74–126) with double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing the a1/(cid:1)2-3A binding site used in the original structural studies of a1/(cid:1)2/DNA complex [10] in a molar ratio of 1:1:1.2. A series of duplex DNA with various DNA lengths and end compositions were tested for complex crystal formation using the vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the ternary complexes were successfully grown with 20-base pair oligonucleotides with either A/T or G/C overhangs, but not with the 21-base pair DNA fragments. Two crystal forms (I and II) with different cell dimensions were observed in similar crystallization conditions. Both form in space group P65 instead of P61, which was the space group in the wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA crystals [10, 28]. This is probably because the one-base pair difference in DNA length in the two structures results in a different angular relationship between stacked oligonucleotides in the crystal lattice. The roughly 33(cid:2) rotational difference at the junction between stacked oligonucleotides causes the pseudocon- tinuous DNA superhelix to change from right-handed, as in a1/(cid:1)2/ DNA crystal, to left-handed in the a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA crystal. The hexag- onal bipyramid crystals (form I) diffracted to only 3.2 A˚ , despite variousattempts toimprovethe resolution.Theneedle crystals(form II) were of better diffraction quality (2.6 A˚ ). Various a1/(cid:1)2-3A binding site sequences were tested to improve diffraction resolution. The complex crystals containing the consensus in vivo a1/(cid:1)2-3A binding site DNA sequence [28] grown in conditions containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10% PEG 400, 10 mM CaCl2, and 8 mM Co(NH3)6Cl3 diffracted anisotropically, with maximum resolution of 2.3 A˚ at 98(cid:2)K at beamline 12A at the Advanced Photon Source, and were used for structural analysis.
The structure of a1/(cid:1)2-3A/DNA ternary complex was solved by molecular replacement using Amore [19]. The wild-type a1/(cid:1)2/DNA complex structure was used as a search model, excluding all water molecules. One unique solution was found after rotation and transla- tion searchusing reflectiondata from12–3.5 A˚ .The R factordropped from 50% to 32% after rigid body refinement with CCP4 [29]. The initial electron density map at 2.3 A˚ clearly showed the absence of side chains at the alanine-substitution positions in (cid:1)2-3A (Ser50, Asn51, and Arg54). The structure was then refined with CNS [20] followed by manual rebuilding with the program O. A typical round of refinement included simulated annealing, individual B factor re- finement, energy minimization, and automated water picking. Simu- lated annealing omit maps were frequently generated to verify differ- ent parts of the protein/DNA model and each of the water positions. The final refinement statistics are 25.8% for R factor and 29.8% for Rfree at 2.3 A˚ resolution.
In Vivo Repression Assays pJM130, a CEN LEU2 plasmid bearing MAT(cid:1) with an engineered MAT(cid:1)2 that contains silent restriction sites, has been described previously [30]. The (cid:1)2-3A(cid:14)N47A mutant was made by ligating an- nealed oligonucleotides (sequences available upon request) bearing the site-directed mutations into BamHI/NheI-digested pJM130. Mu- tations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The Asn47Ala and (cid:1)2-3A mutants were made in pAV115, a CEN LEU2 plasmid bearing MAT(cid:1), as described previously [17]. Plasmids were transformed into yeast strain a79, (MATa ura3 trp1 leu2 his4) bearing an integrated CYC1-lacZ reporter with an a1/(cid:1)2 binding site inserted between the UAS and TATA of CYC1 [7]. (cid:10)-galactosidase assays were performed on three independent transformants as described previously [2]. Lysates were prepared from transformed a79 cultures by precipita- tion with trichloroacetic acid, and Western blots were performed using a rabbit antiserum to Mat(cid:1)2p (a gift from Sandy Johnson) and HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad).
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetric titrations were carried out using the MicroCal Omega 2 instrument. All samples were dialyzed into a buffer composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA to avoid any heat of dilution from mixing buffers. All solutions were degassed before the titrations. Protein solutions (wild-type, mutant (cid:1)2, or premixed equimolar of a1 and (cid:1)2 [typically 0.1 mM]) were titrated at constant temperature (20(cid:2)C) with a 250 (cid:12)l syringe into solution containing a 23-base pair DNA fragment
containing the a1/(cid:1)2 binding site (typically 0.007 mM) in the 1.37 ml reaction cell. Each titration consisted of a preliminary 1.0 (cid:12)l injection (neglected in the data analysis). Heats of dilution were measured in blank titrations by injecting the same protein sample to buffer lacking DNA and were subtracted from the experimental data. The same set of experiments was repeated with phosphate buffer to confirm that the large negative enthalpy observed in the titration experiments were not due to proton exchange between protein molecules and the buffer. The protein and the DNA concen- trations were measured by taking an absorbance reading at 280 nm or 260 nm, respectively. The calorimetry data were analyzed to obtain the binding constant, stoichiometry, and binding enthalpy using the single set of identical binding sites model within the ITC data analysis package of the Origin software (Microcal, Northamp- ton, MA). The error margins were obtained using the same software package.
