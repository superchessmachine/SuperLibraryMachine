Abstract Sirtuins are a family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases widely distributed in all phyla of life. Accumulating evidence in- dicates that sirtuins are important regulators of organism life span. In yeast, these unique enzymes regulate gene silencing by histone deacetylation and via formation of the novel compound 2(cid:2)-O-acetyl- ADP-ribose. In multicellular organisms, sirtuins deacetylate his- tones and transcription factors that regulate stress, metabolism, and survival pathways. The chemical mechanism of sirtuins provides novelopportunitiesforsignalingandmetabolicregulationofprotein deacetylation. The biological, chemical, and structural characteris- tics of these unusual enzymes are discussed in this review.

INTRODUCTION AND BRIEF HISTORY OF SIRTUINS
Contents
Sir2 is the founding member of a large and diverse family of protein-modifying en- zymes known as sirtuins, which regulate key pathways throughout biology: in eubacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and even viruses (1). Consistent with the role of yeast Sir2 in si- lencing transcription, this enzyme is a histone deacetylase (2–4). Unlike previously charac- terized histone deacetylases, however, which catalyze the simple hydrolysis of acetylly- sine (5, 6), Sir2 was shown to deacetylate lysine residues in a novel chemical reaction that consumes nicotinamide adenine dinu- cleotide (NAD+), releasing nicotinamide, O- acetylADPribose(AADPR),andthedeacety- lated substrate. The basic chemistry and enzymology of this reaction are summarized in Figure 1. The seemingly baroque and en- ergeticallycostlychemistryofsirtuinspermits their enzymatic activity to be regulated by a variety of metabolites and may enable the en- zyme to serve other chemical functions in ad- dition to deacetylation. As studies continue to uncover the roles that members of the sirtuin family play in important biological processes, such as life span regulation (7–11), fat mo- bilization in human cells (12), insulin secre- tion (13), cellular response to stress (11, 14, 15), axonal degeneration (16), basal transcrip- tion factor activity (17), regulating enzyme activity (18), rDNA recombination (19–21), and switching between morphological states in Candida (22) and apoptosis (23, 24), there has been substantial progress in uncovering the chemical and structural details of these fascinating enzymes.

telomeres (28), and in the rDNA (21, 29, 30). In all three types of silent loci, the histone deacetylase Sir2p, the only Sir protein with an enzymatic activity, is required for all three types of silencing. The other three Sir pro- teins play active roles in silencing only at the HM loci and telomeres. This is reﬂected by the fact that Sir2p can interact with differ- ent molecular partners; Sir3p and Sir4p inter- act with Sir2p in the HM loci and telomeres, whereas Net1p/Cﬁ1p interacts with Sir2p in the rDNA to form a completely distinct com- plex with roles in cell cycle control, as well as silencing (31, 32).
yeast also harbor, on the same chromosome as the MAT locus, but distinct from it, two “silent” copies of the mating-type informa- tion known as HMRa and HMLα (collectively referred to as the HM loci), which encode the a and α information, respectively, but which are transcriptionally silent. The SIR2 gene was ﬁrst identiﬁed in yeast via a muta- tion, originally called mar1-1. Klar and col- leagues (25) isolated and analyzed a sponta- neous mutant with genetic properties indicat- ing a defect in maintaining the silent state of the HM loci. The interpretation of the com- plexpanoplyofphenotypesconferredbythese early sir mutants played a pivotal role in not only establishing the phenomenon of tran- scriptional silencing per se, but also helping to deﬁne the pivotal cassette model for yeast mating-typeinterconversion.Similarmutants were isolated by several other groups (26, 27), and these mutants deﬁne the four SIR genes, now known to function collectively in main- taining silencing at the HM loci, at all yeast

sirtuins, all six proteins have N-terminal ex- tensions of 30 or more residues relative to a bacterial sirtuin, which presumably repre- sents the core catalytic subunit. It is conceiv- ablethattheseterminaldomainsbindtodistal sites on substrate macromolecular complexes and do mechanical work as a consequence of the catalysis, as large conformational changes are thought to accompany the catalytic cycle (37). In this connection, it is interesting that sirtuin substrates include at least two large ﬁ- brous macromolecular complexes, chromatin (yeast Sir2) and tubulin (human SirT2) (38). The various sirtuins have very diverse substrates (see Table 1). These can be broken down into three major overlapping classes: transcriptional, apoptosis regulating, and metabolic regulating. In general, tran- scriptional downregulation by sirtuins is asso- ciated with deacetylation of histones, at least in microorganisms, and there is extensive ev- idence that this deacetylation leads to tran- scriptional downregulation in the case of si- lencing in S. cerevisiae. Histones H3 and H4 are physiological substrates for yeast Sir2 and Hst1 proteins, and there is extensive evidence that K16 in histone H4 is a critical residue for transcriptional silencing, apparently by con- trolling binding of Sir3p and Sir4p to histone H4 N termini (37, 39, 40). The Sir2p protein alsoshowsspeciﬁcityinvitrofordeacetylation of the K16 residue (2).
sirtuin, although there are exceptions, such as the archeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, which en- codes two sirtuins. Eukaryotes typically have multiple sirtuins, with yeast containing four sirtuins (Hst1–4) in addition to Sir2p, and humans containing seven (SirT1–7) sirtuins. The presence of multiple sirtuin species en- coded in eukaryotic genomes naturally in- vites speculation as to the biological roles of the different types of sirtuins. Phylogenetic analyses by Frye (33, 34), which analyzed se- quence conservation in the ∼250 amino acid core domain, have organized the sirtuins into ﬁve main classes. Class I is eukaryote speciﬁc and includes yeast Sir2 and the four Hst pro- teins, as well as mammalian SirT1, SirT2, and SirT3. Class II includes mammalian SirT4, as wellasanumberofrelatedeukaryoticsirtuins, but also includes a number of bacterial pro- teins.ClassIIIismostlycomposedofbacterial sirtuins (both archaeal and eubacterial), but also includes mammalian SirT5 and a num- ber of other eukaryotic orthologs. Class IV includes mammalian SirT6 and SirT7 and is also eukaryote speciﬁc. Finally, Class U con- tains sequences unique to gram-positive eu- bacteria. A more extensive analysis of addi- tional sequences (W. Hawse & C. Wolberger, unpublished data) suggests that modest revi- sions to this scheme are required to reﬂect moreaccuratelytheincreasedsequencediver- sity of data now available. There are no obvi- ousbiologicalcorrelationsbetweenthesirtuin classes and speciﬁc biological functions. For example, histone and tubulin deacetylases are foundinClassI,asisamitochondria-localized deacetylase.
Inanotherwell-studiedyeast,Schizosaccha- romyces pombe, sirtuins play roles in the tran- scriptional silencing of telomeres and cryptic mating loci (41), and also of centromeres (42). However, in S. pombe (and in most eukary- otes,butnotinS.cerevisiae),aseparateformof posttranscriptionalsilencing,theRNAi(RNA interference) system, operates as well. Re- markably, the RNAi system is also intimately involved in establishing the sites of transcrip- tional silencing, mediated through Su(var3- 9)-dependent methylation of K9 in histone H3;thismodiﬁcationcreatesasiteforthema- jorheterochromatinprotein1(HP1)(43).Itis interestingthatpotentsilencinginS.cerevisiae can occur in the absence of the RNAi system,
Some sirtuins, including yeast Sir2 and its orthologs, contain signiﬁcant extensions that ﬂank the conserved enzymatic core at the N and C termini. Human SirT1, for example, has ∼240 amino acid N- and C-terminal ex- tensions. There is some evidence that these extensions may promote binding to speciﬁc substrates (35). In the case of Sir2, there is good evidence that these regions contain binding sites for Sir4, which forms a complex with Sir2 in the cell (36). Among the human

dation, and thus deacetylation of p53 by sir- tuins is predicted to lead to its destruction by an MDM2-dependent ubiquitin-mediated pathway. The p53 protein activates the tran- scriptional program that promotes apoptosis, and thus decreases in p53 abundance reduce apoptosis. However, deacetylation of p53 may also play more direct roles in apoptosis, as many additional functions beyond serving as a transcriptional regulator have been ascribed to p53. SirT1 is localized to PML bodies, where p53 and other apoptotic proteins also reside (49). Mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts lack- ing SirT1 have unlimited replicative life span, and although p53 is highly acetylated, it is rendered less stable owing to upregulation of p19Arf (50). Hyperacetylation of p53 occurs insirt1knockoutanimals(51),providingcom- pelling evidence that the SirT1/p53 interac- tion is meaningful in vivo.
K9 methylation, and HP1 and its associated machinery; this suggests that lysine deacety- lation by sirtuins may represent an ancestral form of silencing, whereas histone methyla- tion and RNAi and DNA methylation repre- sent more advanced, eukaryote-speciﬁc evo- lutionary embellishments. Accordingly, in S. pombe, prior deacetylation of K9 by a sirtuin appears to be required for subsequent lysine methylation (44).
In metazoans, if and how sirtuins gener- ally downregulate gene expression is far less clear, and there is no direct evidence that his- tone deacetylation in vivo by SirT1, the clos- est homolog of Sir2p, globally controls tran- scription. In fact, SirT1 is not necessary for maintaining global silencing of the genome in embryonic stem cells (45). One recent pub- lication (46) did, however, report that SirT1 can carry out local deacetylation of chromatin quite similar to that seen in silent loci in S. cerevisiae. In this study, SirT1 was tethered to a GAL4 binding site, where it also deacety- latedhistoneH1,thelinkerhistoneassociated with heterochromatin, which is absent from S. cerevisiae (46). In addition, a native chicken transcription factor appears to recruit SIRT1 to speciﬁc target DNA sites, at which it ap- parently deacetylates histones (47).
FOXO(ForkheadboxtypeO)proteinsare another important set of transcription factors regulated by SirT1. The proteins are orthol- ogous to the Dauer-formation (Daf)-16 pro- tein that controls longevity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (52) and are part of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway. Interestingly, in the nematode, excess Sir2 ac- tivity extends life span and this requires Daf- 16 (7). This Dauer-formation protein is part ofaspecializedpathwaythatallowslong-term survival in response to stress in the nema- tode; extension of life span is indeed Daf-16 dependent (7). Both pro- and antitranscrip- tional effects of sirtuins on the homologous mammalian FOXO factors have been noted (Table 1) (53), indicating that the connec- tion between Sir2 and these factors is not an artifact of the specialized pathway. As is the case with p53, SirT1-mediated deacetyla- tion is anti-apoptotic and promotes cell sur- vival. An important member of this family, FOXO3a, is deacetylated by SirT1, as is the p300 acetyltransferase that acetylates it (23, 54).
Whether or not histone deacetylation is a major mechanism of SirT1 action in mam- malian cells, a variety of mammalian tran- scription factors have been identiﬁed as Sir2 substrates, and in some cases deacetylation of these transcription factors is associated with transcriptional activation rather than repres- sion. In most cases, these transcription fac- tors control genes related to growth, cell cy- cle, and/or apoptosis control. A good example is p53, which carries several acetylation sites (along with a number of other modiﬁcations) in its C-terminal domain; several of these are excellent substrates for SirT1 (24, 48). The precise role of the acetylation as well as the relative contributions of sirtuins and NAD+- independent deacetylases to its deacetylation are debated. The consensus is that deacetyla- tion of the protein is required for its degra-

tors, and this resulted in deacetylation of speciﬁc lysines in PGC-1α. This led to up- regulation of the gluconeogenic pathway and downregulation of the glycolytic pathway, presumably in response to changes in NAD+ or a related metabolite (56). This is a good ex- ample of SirT1 having both and pro- and an- titranscriptional effects in a single study and, presumably,asaconsequenceofdeacetylation of a single substrate.
A unique example is the eubacterial acetyl- CoA (coenzyme A) synthetase enzyme, which is regulated directly by cobB, the correspond- ingsirtuinthatremovesanacetylresiduefrom a critical lysine in the active site, thereby ac- tivating it for catalysis (55). Interestingly, this protein is part of a larger superfamily of pro- teins, including nonribosomal peptide syn- thetases and luciferases, which suggests that potentially these can all be activated in the same way. Thus far this protein family is the only instance of an enzyme activity directly regulated by lysine acetylation.
Biological Effects of O-Acetyl-ADP-Ribose as a Potential Effector Molecule
Two mammalian regulatory proteins de- serve special mention in the metabolic con- text, PPARγ and its coactivator PGC-1α. A critical mechanism controlling energy metabolism in metazoans is their ability to storefatinspecializedadiposetissues.Inthese tissues, PPARγ regulates fat storage by con- trolling the expression of adipogenic-speciﬁc genes. However, how PPARγ is regulated is not totally understood. Fatty acids are mobi- lized from white fat during food withdrawal by activating lipolysis, and it has been sug- gested that SirT1 plays a role in this process (12). Insulin treatment of pre-adipocytes re- sults in adipogenesis, and under these con- ditions, SirT1 levels rise. In this context, overexpression of SirT1 leads to reduced fat accumulation (12). The effect is mediated by repressionofPPARγthroughitsnegativereg- ulatory subunit NcoR, a transcriptional core- pressor recruited by PPARγ and to which SirT1 binds (12). Finally, SirT1 was observed bound to chromatin near PPARγ-regulated genes only in food-deprivation conditions, suggesting that lipolysis was activated. This binding suggests that SirT1 may exert its ef- fect on transcription in this context by target- ing histone proteins.
In most literature to date, the biological ef- fect of sirtuins is presumed to derive from the removal of an acetyl group from lysine side chains.TheSir2proteiniscapableofdeacety- lating multiple lysines in the N termini of hi- stones H3 and H4, although K16 is known fromgeneticexperimentstobeakeysubstrate (57). However hypoacetylation is observed at these other sites in histones H3 and H4, at telomeres, and at HM loci (58). Perplexingly, mutation of Sas2, the major K16 acetyltrans- ferase, fails to suppress a knockout of Sir2 (59, 60), suggesting an additional silencing func- tion for Sir2 beyond its deacetylating activ- ity. However, there was an early investigation into the possibility that another sirtuin reac- tion product, O-AADPR, may have biological activity as a novel signaling molecule (61).
EvidencefortheimportanceofO-AADPR as a biological effector molecule is limited but accumulating. The ﬁrst demonstration of its potential came from the observation that microinjection of starﬁsh oocytes with AADPR could delay or block embryonic cell division (61). If AADPR is indeed a signal- ing molecule, it would then be likely that cells haveamechanismforbreakingthismetabolite down when it is no longer required. A family of enzymes called nudix hydrolases can cleave pyrophosphate bonds, and some of these en- zymes degrade AADPR, as well as ADPR (62).Interestingly,thesestudiesalsoidentiﬁed two other activities speciﬁc for degradation

(68). In yeast, nicotinamide is deaminated by Pnc1p (pyrazin-amide/nicotinamide hydro- lase), converting it to nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid is then converted to NaMN (nicotinic acid mononucleotide) by nicotinic acid phos- phoribosyltransferase. In mammalian cells, however, nicotinamide is converted directly to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by Nampt (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltrans- ferase). Increased expression of Nampt in re- sponse to various stresses elevates cellular NAD+ levels, which in turn regulate cat- alytic activity of Sir2 (69). Recent evidence suggests that changes in NAD+ metabolites can have tissue-speciﬁc effects: For example, NAD+ increases in nuclear neurons prevent axonal degeneration in a SirT1-dependent manner. (16). Mammalian de novo biosynthe- sis is also organized differently than in plants and prokaryotes (70, 71).
of AADPR, an esterase and an acetyltrans- ferase. Structural studies show that AADPR can form a complex with the sirtuin that pro- duced it, suggesting that AADPRs can be po- tent biological inhibitors of sirtuins (63, 64). A more clear-cut case for a biological role for these molecules is in yeast silencing, in which Liou and colleagues (37) showed dra- matic evidence that AADPR stimulates for- mation of the Sir2p/Sir3p/Sir4p complex by recruiting Sir3p from a Sir3p homopolymeric state into a preformed Sir2p/Sir4p complex. Although the binding site of AADPR is not known, an intriguing possibility is the AAA ATPase domain of Sir3p, which lacks the cat- alytic residues found in other AAA ATPases, but presumably retains the nucleotide bind- ing site that could potentially bind AADPR. There is also some evidence that macroH2A, a variant histone incorporated into regions si- lenced by X-chromosome inactivation, may also bind AADPR (65), albeit no more avidly than ADP-ribose. The full implications of the signaling potential of AADPR are likely to be highly signiﬁcant, but remain to be clariﬁed.
Studies from the Sinclair and Smith labs have implicated nicotinamide as a potent in vivo inhibitor of Sir2p (14, 72–74). Exoge- nously added nicotinamide phenocopies a sir2 mutant, providing a clear demonstration of potent nicotinamide effects on Sir2p in vivo and simultaneously deﬁning an important pharmacologic tool for probing sirtuin in- volvementinavarietyofpathwaysinyeastand mammalian cells. In addition, overexpression of Pnc1p activates Sir2p in vitro and in vivo, indicating that levels of nicotinamide natu- rally produced by sirtuins (and perhaps other enzyme activities) are sufﬁcient to inhibit Sir2p; elevation of Pnc1p activity increases sirtuin activity. Although changes in the ac- tivity of this NAD+ salvage pathway enzyme may affect Sir2p activity through an alteration ofnuclearNAD+ levels,furtherstudiesimpli- cate the change in nuclear nicotinamide con- centrations as the primary cause of the change in Sir2-mediated silencing (74). This view of Sir2p regulation was recently supported by chemical interference of nicotinamide with a nicotinamide isostere called isonicoti- namide, which enhances Sir2-mediated si- lencing (75). Interestingly, the Pnc1 enzyme itself is directly regulated by various forms
NAD+ Metabolism and Sirtuin Activity
Because sirtuins are absolutely dependent on NAD+, the abundance of free NAD+ and its biosynthetic and breakdown products in cells are very relevant to the enzymatic activity of sirtuins. There are two main routes to NAD+ biosynthesisinyeastandmammals(Figure2): a de novo kynurenine pathway, derived from tryptophan as a precursor, and a salvage path- waythatutilizesnicotinamide,producedfrom NAD+ by sirtuins as well as ADP-ribosyl- transferases and polymerases or exogenous nicotinic acid (66). Finally, Bieganowski & Brenner (67) recently identiﬁed a novel path- way to NAD+ in yeast and humans, start- ing from nicotinamide riboside, which can be provided externally. Another important re- cent ﬁnding is that mammalian cells have a fundamentally different salvage pathway than the one known in bacteria and yeast

Mammals notably lack an enzyme to degrade nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinic acid (NA) (Pnc1p), but compensate by producing an enzyme known as Nampt [nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; also known as pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF)], which can directly convert nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN).

(79). Experiments suggest that in these cells, NAD+/NADH ratios are increased, and this may increase sirtuin activity due to relief of inhibition by NADH, providing a possible mechanism for the life span extension. Be- cause the absolute levels of free pyridine nu- cleotidesinnucleiaredifﬁculttodetermine,it is difﬁcult to rigorously evaluate this possibil- ity. Alternatively, the activation of yeast Pnc1 owing to CR-induced stress would lead to a decrease in nicotinamide and the activation of Sir2 activity. Although either or both of these mechanisms may account for the effect of CR on Sir2 activity, it remains to be shown why an increase in Sir2 activity increases yeast life span and whether this mechanism is relevant to higher organisms.
of stress, indicating that there is potentially a cellular signaling system that telegraphs various stress responses to the cell via chemo- modulation of Sir2p activity (14, 74). Re- markably, recent studies in mammalian cells established that the enzyme Nampt, which carries out a completely different enzymatic, nicotinamide-consuming reaction process in mammalian cells, performs and regulates the analogous nicotinamide-scavenging function, although the topology of this NAD+ salvage pathway is rather different from the yeast pathway (69) (Figure 2).
Sirtuins, Caloric Restriction, and Aging
Pharmacologic approaches have also pro- vided interesting support for the notion that elevated Sir2 activity promotes longevity. Treatment of yeast cells with resveratrol, an agonist of Sir2 (at least in certain in vitro as- says) extends mother cell longevity in a Sir2- dependent manner (10). Experiments in hu- man tissue culture cells (80), C. elegans, and Drosophila (81, 82) suggest that resveratrol (andrelatedpolyphenoliccompounds)canin- crease longevity in very diverse organisms. These studies are confounded by the fact thatresveratrolonlysigniﬁcantlyactivateshu- man SirT1 and not yeast Sir2p in vitro, and only in a nonphysiologic assay. The SirT1 activation requires a ﬂuorophore in the sub- strate absent from native substrates (83). An- other study conﬁrmed the SirT1 speciﬁcity and alleged a general lack of evidence for in vivo stimulation of Sir2p activity; that is, the strength of its silencing phenotypes was not enhanced by resveratrol treatment, nor was mother cell longevity enhanced in two differ- ent strain backgrounds tested (84). From this and other studies (78), it is clear that there can bemultiplemechanismsoflifespanextension, some Sir2p dependent and some Sir2p inde- pendent, and that these mechanisms vary be- tween yeast strain backgrounds, which are ge- netically diverse. One recent study implicated theSir2pparalogHst2pinSir2p-independent
The complex and controversial relationships between Sir2 proteins, caloric restriction (CR), and aging have been reviewed in depth (76, 77) and are covered more brieﬂy here. Accumulated evidence suggests that sirtuins are involved in promoting longevity, particu- larly longevity associated with CR regimens, in several organisms. Two key early ﬁndings supporting this are the discovery that extra doses of sirtuins promote longevity in C. el- egans (7) and the correlation of yeast mother cell longevity (a somewhat specialized model for longevity) with the activity of Sir2 and other Sir proteins (78). When yeast cells di- vide asymmetrically, the mother cells (the larger of the two cells) can divide only a ﬁ- nite number of times, typically 20–30 times. Mutants lacking Sir2 have a shortened life span in that they divide a fewer number of times. Prematurely aging sir2 mutant mother cells were shown to accumulate extrachromo- somal rDNA circles, which accumulate be- cause rDNA recombination is disregulated in the sir2 mutant (20, 21, 77). Subsequent stud- ies showed that CR could be mimicked in yeast by a simple glucose starvation regimen.

cases that the reaction is an ADP-ribosylation reaction, although only limited evidence for this has been provided. In one case (90), ev- idence is presented that an antibody speciﬁc for ADPR recognizes the products.

mothercelllifespanextension(85).Returning to resveratrol and related compounds, these tend to be bioactive in a number of signal- ing pathways unrelated to Sir2p, which means biological results in response to these com- pounds must be interpreted cautiously.
Although the speciﬁcs of the resveratrol connection to Sir2p remain controversial, there is an elegant theoretical underpinning for a connection. Molecules like resveratrol, produced in abundance by plants undergoing a variety of environmental stresses, may actu- ally have been exploited as an interspecies sig- nalthatallowsotherorganismsfeedingonthe plant material to detect environmental stres- sors, referred to as xenohormesis (86).
The striking biochemical activities of sir- tuins make it clear that they are an important classofprotein-modifyingenzymes.Theirre- quirementforahigh-energycofactor,NAD+, ties them directly to a cellular metabolic states. Could there be more to the sirtuin re- action than the simple removal (or addition) of a small chemical modiﬁcation on proteins? Could they actually be involved in more com- plex biochemical reactions that directly effect changes in the structure of large macromolec- ular complexes such as chromatin? The ex- penditure of a high-energy bond during the deacetylation reaction is consistent with such a function. Alternatively, recent results from the Moazed lab (37) suggest that the Sir2- deacetylation reaction product O-AADPR, rather than enzyme movements, may be suf- ﬁcient to promote or stabilize the formation of a silent chromatin structure.
Sirtuin Activities: Deacetylase or ADP-Ribosyl Transferase The NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity is well established for a multitude of sirtuin en- zymes. Catalytic activity has been demon- strated in vitro with puriﬁed proteins and spe- ciﬁcsitesofdeacetylationhavebeenidentiﬁed (Table 1). However, the initial report of en- zymatic activity in yeast Sir2 described weak mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (ART) activ- ity (87). For sirtuins, this function had been anticipated on the basis of indirect genetic experiments in Salmonella typhimurium in which cobB, a bacterial sirtuin, was shown to complement a deletion of a mononucleotide phosphoribosyltransferase in the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway (88). With the discov- ery of the more robust NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity in yeast Sir2 and other sirtuins, the ART activity was attributed to nonenzymatic labeling. However, two recent publications (89, 90) provide evidence for the transfer of radioactive phosphate from NAD+ to a target protein(s) in vitro that is highly el- evated in two speciﬁc sirtuins, a speciﬁc try- panosomal sirtuin that both deacetylates and transfers labels from NAD+ to histones (89) and the human SirT6 protein (90), which autolabels with 32P-labeled NAD+ but lacks deacetylase activity. It is assumed in all these
CHEMICAL MECHANISM OF SIRTUINS
The unexpected and chemically unnecessary involvement of NAD+ in the deacetylation reaction catalyzed by sirtuins has led to ex- tensive investigation into the chemical mech- anism. The NAD+ requirement sets sirtuin chemistry apart from all known deacety- lases but links the sirtuins to the ribosyl transferases.
ADP-Ribosyl Transferase Chemistry
Sirtuins belong to a widely distributed group of enzymes called ADP-ribosyl transferases, which catalyze transfer of the ADPR group of NAD+ to nucleophiles (97). Members this group of enzymes include ARTs of

form an ADPR intermediate during cataly- sis (105, 106). Sirtuins therefore use ADP- ribosyl transfer as an integral feature of their catalytic mechanisms. The apparent coupling of ADP-ribosyl transferase chemistry with protein deacetylation is a remarkable feature that provides unique biochemical opportuni- ties for signaling and metabolic regulation. The chemistry, mechanisms, and structural characteristics that illuminate the novelty of these catalysts are discussed below.
(98), which posttranslationally modify nu- cleophilic protein side-chain residues with the ADPR moiety (a group of enzymes that include the bacterial toxins and mam- malian Arg ADP-ribosyl transferases), the poly-ADP-polymerases (PARP) (99), which synthesize ADPR polymers onto proteins, and the ADP-ribosyl cyclases/NAD+ gly- cohydrolases (100), which hydrolyze NAD+ and also form the signaling molecule cyclic- ADPR (cADPR) from NAD+. The synthesis of cADPR is accomplished by a cyclization reaction via intramolecular ADP ribosylation of the N1 position of adenine (100). This en- zyme can also synthesize nicotinic acid ade- nine dinucleotide (NAADP) from NADP via a nicotinic acid/nicotinamide base-exchange reaction (100).
Products and Solvent Labeling Patterns
In 2000, three independent laboratories re- ported sirtuin NAD+-dependent deacetyla- tion (2–4). The role of NAD+ in this re- action was originally undetermined, but a tight coupling of NAD+ consumption with amide deacetylation conﬁrmed stoichiomet- ricrequirementofNAD+ inthedeacetylation reaction (101). A novel product, AADPR, was later identiﬁed as the acetyl acceptor, formed via acetyltransfer to NAD+ with hydrolysis of the nicotinamide bond (107, 108). The sto- ichiometric involvement of water was estab- lished by 18O isotope labeling of AADPR de- rived from Sir2 reactions conducted in 18O water (109).
The sirtuin NAD+-dependent deacetyla- tion reaction is not an ADP-ribosyl trans- ferase reaction in the traditional sense. How- ever, several reactions that are catalyzed by sirtuin enzymes involve ribosyl trans- fer. For example, the ﬁrst reaction char- acterized for a sirtuin was a ribosyltrans- fer reaction catalyzed by cobB (88), a Sir2 homologue found in bacteria in which 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole is substituted for nicotinic acid of NaMN to form the metabo- liteα-ribose-5,6-benzimidazole(88).Thisre- action accomplishes synthesis of a neces- sary metabolite on the pathway of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis (88). The discovery of this reaction not only provided a clear ex- ample of ribosyltransferase activity for this family of enzymes, but led to the eventual discovery of NAD+-dependent deacetylase and ADP-ribosyl transferase activities of sir- tuins. Observations that sirtuins (archaean, yeast, mouse, and human) catalyze a nicoti- namide base-exchange reaction, in which ra- diolabeled nicotinamide is exchanged into NAD+, demonstrate that sirtuins are ADP- ribosyl transferases (101–104). This reaction is diagnostic for reversible formation of an ADPR intermediate formed on the enzyme and is a well-known feature of ADP-ribosyl- cyclase/NAD+ glycohydrolase enzymes that
The deﬁnitive mechanism of Sir2 catalysis was provided by the complete identiﬁcation of the AADPR reaction product. This previ- ously unknown compound was ﬁrst detected by mass spectrometry and high-pressure liq- uid chromatography (HPLC) and mistakenly identiﬁed as β-1(cid:2)-AADPR (107). Indepen- dent synthesis of 1(cid:2)-AADPR and comparison to Sir2-derived AADPR determined them to be different (109). Sir2-derived AADPR was fully characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR and identiﬁed as an equilibrating mix- tureof2(cid:2)-and3(cid:2)-AADPR(109,110),inwhich onlythe2(cid:2)-AADPRisomerwastheimmediate enzymatic product (109, 110).

archaea, eubacteria, yeast, mouse, and human sources (2–4, 101, 102, 107–110).
The stoichiometric involvement of NAD+ is kinetically and thermodynamically un- necessary to achieve protein deacetylation. Widely distributed Class I and Class II HDACs catalyze deacetylation using only wa- ter as a cosubstrate (Reaction I; Figure 3), with a favorable free energy change and an equilibrium constant in favor of products on the order of 500 at pH 7.5 (6, 111). One ra- tionale for the involvement of NAD+ in sir- tuin deacetylation chemistry is the synthe- sis of the novel reaction product AADPR. Sirtuin deacetylation catalysis couples amide hydrolysis to ester synthesis (AADPR synthe- sis). Amide-to-ester acyltransfer is unfavor- able(ReactionIandII)(111),buthydrolysisof NAD+ (Reaction III) can provide a favorable driving force for the overall sirtuin reaction (Reaction IV). The free energy change for the sirtuin deacetylation reaction is compara- ble to Reaction I alone; therefore there is no energetic reason to favor coupling of NAD+ consumption with deacetylation. A complete stoichiometry establishes three reactants and three products for sirtuin deacetylation re- actions. The mechanistic basis for protein deacetylation as catalyzed by sirtuins is en- tirely unprecedented. The biological logic of consuming NAD+ in deacetylation reactions may be rooted in the advantage of forming a
Base exchange. Sirtuins catalyze the ex- change of radiolabeled nicotinamide into NAD+, thereby displaying reversible loss of the high-energy nicotinamide-ribose bond, a characteristic of enzymes that form the cova- lent ADPR intermediate such as that formed on the ADP-ribosylcyclase CD38 (105, 112). Properties of this ADPR intermediate in- clude a sufﬁcient life span to permit ex- change of nicotinamide into the active site and preservation of the energy of the original nicotinamide-ribosebondofNAD+ topermit reversible reactivity of the intermediate with nicotinamide (105). An important feature of the exchange reaction catalyzed by sirtuins is that it occurs only when an acetylated protein or peptide substrate is present in the reaction mixture (101, 102). The requirement of pep- tideinthisprocesshasbeeninterpretedintwo ways. One proposal is that peptide binding fa- cilitates an allosteric change in enzyme struc- ture that enables the reaction of NAD+ with an enzyme side-chain nucleophile, thereby forming an enzyme-stabilized ADPR in- termediate analogous to that observed in

reactions of CD38/NAD+ glycohydrolase (101, 102, 107). Alternatively, it has been pro- posed that the peptide is required to partici- pate chemically in order to generate the ex- changeable ADPR intermediate (109). X-ray structures support a close approach of the peptide acetylamide and the NAD+ molecule, which would enable formation of an ADPR- peptidyl intermediate (102, 113).
NMR studies. Reactions conducted at low temperature under conditions favorable to observation of a single turnover product formation indicate that Sir2 enzymes form 2(cid:2)-O-AADPR (96, 97). The failure to ob- serve α-1(cid:2)-O-AADPR suggests that this com- poundfailstoformduringenzymaticturnover (96). Spontaneous interconversion of 2(cid:2)-O- AADPR and 3(cid:2)-O-AADPR has been observed by NMR and by HPLC when there is an excess of either regioisomer (96, 97). These species rapidly establish equilibrium in solu- tion, and HPLC analyses of Sir2 reactions al- ways form a mixture of both isomers (109, 110). The biological signiﬁcance of this inter- conversion of acetyl isomers is unknown, but thechemicalphenomenonofacetylmigration between vicinal hydroxyls is well known in carbohydratechemistry.2(cid:2)-and3(cid:2)-O-AADPR are chemically unstable to hydrolytic break- down at physiological pH and form acetate and ADPR (101, 107–110).
Oxygen labeling. Reactions of Sir2 in 18O water show that the mixture of 2(cid:2)- and 3(cid:2)- AADPR is 18O labeled in the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group, conﬁrming that the orig- inal carbonyl double bond of the acetyllysine side chain of substrate is cleaved as a conse- quence of sirtuin deacetylation catalysis and replaced by a new double bond with an oxy- gen derived from solvent (109) (Figure 4). The cleaved O of acetylamide bonds to C1(cid:2) of ADPR, as indicated by 16O labeling of the C1(cid:2) hydroxyl of AADPR determined for Sir2 reactions conducted in 18O water (109) (Figure 4). The observed oxygen isotope- labeling pattern supports the concept that an ADP-ribose(C1(cid:2))-oxygen (acetyl) bond is formed during sirtuin deacetylation catalysis. This covalent bond between C1(cid:2) of ADPR and the carbonyl oxygen from the acetylly- sine provides the hydroxyl that is bonded at the C1(cid:2) position in AADPR (109).

Proposed mechanisms to account for deacetylation and base-exchange reactions catalyzed by Sir2 enzymes. The nucleophilic mechanism proposes that a nucleophilic attack on the amide by the 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl group of NAD+ initiates deacetylation chemistry. According to this mechanism, base exchange occurs at the same time or later than the 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl nucleophilic attack. A conserved histidine at the active site could be involved in activating the hydroxyl for this chemistry. Base exchange could occur if the intermediate is formed reversibly. The enzyme nucleophile mechanism proposes that an enzyme side-chain nucleophile is able to react with NAD+ to stabilize an enzyme-bonded ADPR species that can reverse to account for base-exchange chemistry. This mechanism has been shown to operate for ADP-ribosyl cyclases. A prediction of this mechanism is the formation of β-1(cid:2)-O-AADPR as the acetyltransfer product.

histidine is coordinated to the 3(cid:2)-hydroxyl of the ribose of NAD+, consistent with a cat- alytic role to activate the 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl for nu- cleophilic attack (102, 113). This proposal predicts that acetyltransfer occurs in the cat- alytic mechanism of sirtuins ﬁrst and that loss of nicotinamide occurs second (Figure 5). Several independent observations have dis- credited this mechanism. First, the acetylated NAD+ species has not been observed. Sec- ond, mutagenesis of the highly conserved cat- alytic His residue disables deacetylation catal- ysis but not base exchange (102), suggesting that deacetylation/acetyltransfer reaction oc- cursdownstreamofnicotinamide-bondcleav- age chemistry (102, 109), in direct contra- diction to the proposed mechanism. Finally, the proposed mechanism is eliminated by ob- servations that 2(cid:2)-deoxy-NAD+ compounds retain activity as base-exchange substrates but cannot complete deacetylation chemistry (104). These 2(cid:2)-deoxy and mutagenesis stud- ies support the concept that the deacetylation catalysis requires the 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl and that the histidine provides an activation of nucle- ophilicity. However, it is apparent that the base-exchange process is independent of the presence of the 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl. Consequently, the nucleophilic step in deacetylation cataly- sis on Sir2 enzymes occurs after nicotinamide loss in a step subsequent to the base-exchange reaction.
NAD+ in the presence of nicotinamide to complete the base-exchange mechanism (102, 107). Although attractive as a mechanism, a crystal structure of NAD+ complexed to an A. fulgidus enzyme provided no evidence for a nucleophile in the vicinity of the α-carbon of NAD+ (102). Also problematic for this proposed mechanism is the prediction that the acetyltransfer product would necessarily be formed with retention of conﬁguration to produce β-1(cid:2)-AADPR (107, 108) and not the observed 2(cid:2)-AADPR product.
Adpr-peptidyl-imidate mechanism. A mechanism ﬁrst proposed by the authors the chemistry observed for rationalizes sirtuins (109). This mechanism is called the ADPR-peptidyl-imidate mechanism of sirtuin catalysis. Inherent to this mechanism that base-exchange and deacetylation is pathways are united by a common reaction intermediate known as the ADPR-peptidyl- imidateComplexIII(109),whichisformedby electrophilic capture of the acetyl oxygen in an ADP-ribosyl transfer reaction (Figure 6). This chemical step accounts for the re- quirement of peptide in base exchange (101, 102, 109), the observed lack of an enzyme nucleophile in X-ray structures (102), the re- quirement of a C1(cid:2)-O (acetyl) bond-forming step in Sir2 catalysis (109), and the viability of base exchange in the absence of the active site His residue (102) or when 2(cid:2)-OH is removed from substrate (104). The pro- posed capture of an acetyl oxygen by ADPR requires a highly electrophilic ribosylating agent, given the weakness of the amide as a nucleophile (109). However, ADPR-transfer reaction mechanisms have been determined previously for the bacterial toxins by kinetic isotope effects and computational studies (114). These studies show that the enzymes stabilize well-developed oxacarbenium-ion transition states that are highly reactive with nucleophiles (105, 114). A potently reactive oxacarbenium ion is proposed to account for imidate formation (Complex II) in sirtuin transfer reactions (109), but ADP-ribosyl
Enzyme nucleophile mechanism. Another mechanism proposed for Sir2-deacetylation catalysis invokes the precedent of a well- known ADP-ribosyl transferase mechanism to explain the observed base-exchange path- way. In this proposal, NAD+ is attacked by a catalytic site amino acid nucleophile to form a stable ADPR intermediate (Figure 5) (101, 102, 107). This reaction pathway is analo- gous to the well-studied reaction mechanism of CD38, in which a Glu nucleophile reacts with NAD+ to covalently stabilize an ADPR intermediate that can be reversed by reac- tion with nicotinamide (112). Analogously, the sirtuin-reactive intermediate can reform

Peptidyl-imidate mechanism of sirtuin deacetylation. The reaction of sirtuins, as proposed to occur via the electrophilic capture of the peptide acyloxygen by an enzyme-stabilized oxacarbenium-ion transition state (Complex II) to form an ADPR-peptidyl imidate (Complex III). The imidate complex has a long enough lifetime to equilibrate nicotinamide in the active-site nicotinamide pocket and can reform NAD+ by reaction reversal to account for base-exchange reactivity. Subsequent nucleophilic attack on the imidate by the 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl forms an intermediate (Complex IV), which subsequently eliminates to form a proposed oxonium species (Complex V), which can capture water to form a second tetrahedral intermediate (Complex VI). This species is proposed to decompose via elimination of the C1(cid:2) hydroxyl group to generate the 2(cid:2)-O-AADPR as the ﬁnal product on the enzyme (Complex VII). This mechanism accounts for 18O labeling of the acetyl group and 16O labeling of C1(cid:2) hydroxyl as observed by reactions conducted in 18O water.

pear to change sirtuin activity. Kinetic studies of Sir2 have determined Km values for NAD+ in the range of 150–500 μM (10, 72, 83, 84, 103, 104, 116), consistent with physiological control of activity by NAD+ levels. Regula- tionbyNAD+ isespeciallyrelevantinstressed mammalian cells, such as those exposed to genotoxicity or trauma, where NAD+ levels may plummet as a consequence of PARP ac- tivation (117).
convincing evidence of this transition state is not yet available. The ADPR transfer step that forms the imidate is written as a reversible step to account for nicotinamide reactivity through base exchange to reform NAD+ (109).
Subsequent breakdown of the intermedi- ate can occur via attack of the imidate by the ribose 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl, with subsequent at- tackbywatertocompletedeacetylationchem- istry (Figure 6, Complexes III–VII) (103, 104, 109). This order of two sequential nu- cleophilic attacks (2(cid:2)-hydroxyl then water) completes deacetylation, with release of 2(cid:2)- AADPR as the enzymatic product, as ob- served experimentally. The alternative or- der of attacks (water then 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl) would predictably yield an α-1(cid:2)-AADPR compound (104, 105, 109) prior to 2(cid:2)-AADPR forma- tion. To date, there has been no evidence for an α-1(cid:2)-AADPR compound, even at low- temperature studies of Sir2 catalysis (109).
Sirtuins are inhibited noncompetitively (versus both NAD+ and acetyllysine sub- strates)bythenicotinamideproductofthesir- tuin deacetylation reaction. Ki values for this inhibitionhavebeenreportedintherange50– 150 μM (72, 101, 103, 104). Although mea- surements of physiological nicotinamide con- centrations are scarce in the literature, new measurements of nicotinamide in yeast sug- gest that endogenous nicotinamide levels are inhibitory to Sir2 deacetylase activity (cellular concentrations of 10–150 μM) (75). Nicoti- namide inhibition of sirtuins is a consequence of the base-exchange reaction common to sir- tuins (103, 104). This mechanism of nicoti- namide inhibition is supported by the ﬁnding that the Km for nicotinamide exchange and the Ki for nicotinamide inhibition of deacety- lation are similar for evolutionarily diverse sirtuins (archaea, yeast, mouse, and human) (75, 103, 104, 115). Moreover, nicotinamide isosteres that are weak base-exchange sub- strates are correspondingly weak as deacety- lation inhibitors (75, 103, 104).
Direct characterization of any single inter- mediateinthesirtuindeacetylationpathwayis lacking. Convincing evidence for Complexes II–VI (Figure 6) has not been obtained, nor have any of the putative transition states of sirtuin catalysis been clearly identiﬁed by ki- netic isotopic methods. Either result would provide deeper insight into the nature of the chemical transitions that occur on these en- zymes. Despite the lack of direct evidence for thestructuralidentitiesofintermediatesinthe Sir2reactionpathway,theimidatemechanism best explains all available experimental data.
The uniﬁcation of nicotinamide base- exchange reactivity and nicotinamide inhibi- tion of the deacetylation reaction is a conse- quence of the ADPR-imidate mechanism of sirtuin deacetylation. According to this mech- anism, nicotinamide equilibrates at the active site of an ADPR-peptidyl imidate intermedi- ate downstream of NAD+ and peptide reac- tion on the enzyme. Nicotinamide reaction with the intermediate causes reaction rever- sal and depletes the intermediate from the enzyme (90, 91). Because the base-exchange and deacetylation processes compete for the imidate intermediate to complete their

saturates the base-exchange reaction, the deacetylation rate is not completely inhib- ited (103). An extreme case is the A. fulgidus Sir2Af2 enzyme, where at saturation of the base-exchangereaction,thedeacetylationrate retains 75% of the uninhibited rate (103). For yeast Sir2p, the uninhibited rate is reportedly 5% to 35% depending on the identity of pep- tide substrate (103, 104, 115), and for mouse Sir2α, the residual deacetylation rate is 5% (103).
respective reactions, base-exchange deple- tion of the intermediate necessarily inhibits deacetylation catalysis (103, 104). Accord- ingly, equivalence for the base-exchange pa- rameter Km and the inhibition constant Ki is predicted and observed (75, 103, 104, 115). Nicotinamide does not compete for binding with either NAD+ or peptide in this mech- anism, and noncompetitive inhibition occurs with respect to both substrates.
Theimidateintermediatecomplexformed on sirtuin enzymes behaves as a metabolic sensor for nicotinamide (75, 103, 104, 115). A long lifetime for the covalent intermedi- ate [estimated to be in excess of 100 ms at 25◦C (103, 115)] permits full equilibration of intracellular nicotinamide at the active site. When the intermediate reacts backward to reform substrates, deacetylation of sirtuin is inhibited. The reversible reactivity of the in- termediate introduces a novel mechanism of metabolic control on sirtuin reactivity that functions as a reaction checkpoint or switch (103). This nicotinamide checkpoint/switch reverses or forwards NAD+-initiated chem- istry depending on the status of nicotinamide concentration within the cell. In summary, the sirtuin catalytic mechanism provides reac- tion steps (imidate formation) that can be in- creased by metabolite concentration (NAD+) or reversed by another metabolite (nicoti- namide) in the NAD+ biosynthetic pathway. Consequently,themechanismofsirtuinsinte- grates independent and counteracting inputs of the NAD+ biosynthetic pathway to regu- late protein deacetylation. This catalytic con- trol mechanism appears to be unique among enzymatic reactions.
To rationalize partial inhibition by nicoti- namide, Sauve & Schramm (103) argued that the nucleophilic reactivities of the interme- diate leading to base exchange and deacety- lation are sterically independent. This possi- bility can be appreciated by considering that the nicotinamide attacks the imidate from the β-face of the ribosyl sugar, whereas 2(cid:2)- hydroxyl attacks the imidate from the α-face (Figure 6). These nucleophilic attacks can proceed independently. Thus, it was pro- posed that the residual deacetylation rates in the presence of saturating nicotinamide are determined by the partitioning of the intermediate to deacetylation, as predicted by the relative rate constants (k4 and k5) (Figure 6) for base exchange and deacety- lation, respectively (103). As an illustrative case, this model of nicotinamide inhibition predicts that k5 is greater than k4 for the Sir2Af2 enzyme because deacetylation chem- istry is only modestly inhibited by nicoti- namide when the base-exchange reaction is saturated (103). Measurements show that the uninhibited steady-state deacetylation rate (kcat) is faster than the steady-state base- exchangerate(kcat)(103),consistentwithk5 > k4 for this enzyme (103). Conversely, yeast Sir2p, mouse Sir2α, and human SIRT2 are more potently inhibited by nicotinamide, and the steady-state nicotinamide base-exchange rate kcat is faster than the steady-state deacety- lation rate kcat (103, 104). These data indi- cate that nicotinamide reactivity exceeds 2(cid:2)- hydroxyl reactivity (k4 > k5) on these enzymes (103). The biochemical and structural basis for nicotinamide sensitivity is still not well

Nicotinamide Antagonists as Sirtuin Activators
STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF SIRTUINS
Nicotinamide inhibition of sirtuin deacetyla- tion arises from nicotinamide reactivity with theimidateintermediate.Itwasproposedthat a small molecule could ﬁt into the nicoti- namide pocket and selectively inhibit base exchange but not deacetylation (103). The deacetylation reaction could proceed as usual because the 2(cid:2)-hydroxyl remains unhindered by ligand binding to the nicotinamide site. A ligand with these properties is predicted to be a nicotinamide antagonist that can relieve nicotinamide inhibition of sirtuin deacetyla- tion activity (75, 103). A small molecule, ison- icotinamide, was identiﬁed, which inhibits nicotinamide base exchange but does not in- hibit the deacetylation reaction (75). Ob- served values for Ki (deacetylation) and Km (base exchange) both increased in the pres- ence of isonicotinamide, indicating that ison- icotinamide inhibition of nicotinamide base exchange weakens nicotinamide inhibition of the enzyme (75). By virtue of its ability to dis- place nicotinamide from the imidate, isoni- cotinamide can increase deacetylation activity of yeast Sir2 when inhibitory nicotinamide is present (Figure 7) (75). The ability of ison- icotinamide to antagonize nicotinamide sug- gests that it may be able to activate Sir2 in cells to provide evidence of nicotinamide reg- ulation of sirtuins. In yeast, isonicotinamide is a potent stabilizer of heterochromatin for- mation at TEL, rDNA, and HM genetic loci, as determined by both negative and posi- tive growth selections (75). Isonicotinamide binding to Sir2 is weak (at millimolar con- centrations), but the biological effects of this compound have provided chemical evidence for nicotinamide regulation of Sir2 activity in wild-type yeast cells, in agreement with
The unprecedented chemical reaction cat- alyzed by sirtuins implicated a unique ar- rangement of acetyllysine peptide and NAD+ at the catalytic sites of these enzymes. The structural data reported here are from sev- eral structures of sirtuins from lower organ- isms, with structures from human sirtuins still mostly undetermined. The mammalian sir- tuin X-ray structures are of great interest given the rapid effort to describe their bio- logical and biochemical functions.
Structure of the Conserved Catalytic Core of Sirtuins
There are approximately 250 amino acids in the sirtuin’s catalytic core domain, which is conserved among virtually all organisms (Figure 8). A signiﬁcant amount of infor- mation on the structure of the catalytic core and its binding to ligands comes from crys- tallographic studies of the archaeal sirtuins, Sir2Af1 (89) and Sir2Af2 (113, 118, 119), hu- man SirT2 (120), yeast Hst2 (121–123), and bacterialsirtuinscobB(64)andSir2Tm(119). The sirtuin fold consists of two characteristic domains (89, 102, 113, 118–123) (Figure 9). The larger domain adopts the classic pyridine dinucleotide binding fold, or Rossman fold, which is commonly found in proteins that bind NAD+/NADH or NADP+/NADPH (124). The small domain is composed of residues from two insertions within the Ross- mann fold, one comprising a zinc-binding module that contains a structural zinc atom coordinated by four invariant cysteines, and the other forming a helical module that in- cludes a ﬂexible loop.

Activation mechanism of sirtuins by antagonism of nicotinamide. As shown, sirtuins catalyze reaction of NAD+, shown as NAM-ADPR, and a protein acetyllysine group, the acetyl group labeled as ac, to form an imidate intermediate (center top) that releases nicotinamide (NAM). NAM can rebind to reverse the reaction through the base-exchange mechanism (left arrow labeled inhibition), or the imidate complex can proceed downward to complete the deacetylation reaction (dashed arrow). In the presence of nicotinamide, the deacetylation reaction is slow because of depletion of the imidate by nicotinamide reactivity. Isonicotinamide (INAM) can bind the nicotinamide pocket and prevent reaction reversal. The INAM-bound imidate complex can complete deacetylation more efﬁciently (thick arrow), leading to activation of sirtuin catalytic activity in cells.

tures. Although the predominance of pep- tide backbone interactions suggests that there is limited sequence speciﬁcity in binding of the peptide substrate within the enzyme cleft, detailed studies of the substrate speciﬁcity of other sirtuins indicate that these enzymes discriminate among different acetylated sub- strates (115). This speciﬁcity may arise, in part, from residues on the surface of the en- zyme that contact side chains in the peptide substrate, although the effect appears to be relatively modest (113). It is likely that the binding of sirtuins to their biological targets is determined in large part by domains that lie N- or C-terminal to the catalytic core, or by other proteins.
NAD+ Binding NAD+ binds in the cleft between the sirtuin large and small domains, immediately adja- cent to the acetyllysine binding tunnel. The adenine base and the adjacent ribose bind to the Rossmann-fold domain, forming a ﬁxed set of contacts (Figure 9). By contrast, the nicotinamide ring and the adjacent ribose and phosphates are free to adopt a variety of po- sitions in the absence of peptide (102, 113). It is only when the acetyllysine binding tun- nel is occupied, either by acetyllysine (K. Hoff, J. Avalos, K. Sens, and C. Wolberger, manuscript submitted) or by a fortuitously bound PEG (polyethylene glycol) molecule (118), that the nicotinamide is buried within a conserved region, dubbed the C pocket (102). In this conformation, the carboxamide of the nicotinamide hydrogen bonds with an invari- antasparticacid(Asp103ofSir2Af2),aswellas with the backbone carbonyl of Ile102. These interactions rotate the carboxamide 30◦ out of the plane of the nicotinamide ring, in con- trast with the coplanar arrangement seen in the structure of free nicotinamide (119). The nicotinamide ring forms additional van der Waals interactions with other residues within the C pocket. Interestingly, a number of the invariantresiduesthatcomprisethefrontpor- tion of the C pocket and contact nicotinamide

The ribose would then have to undergo a signiﬁcant rotation and translation for the C1(cid:2) of the oxacarbenium to react with the acetyl oxygen. Although a dissociative mech- anism has been proposed for NAD+ cleavage by bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins, those enzymes contain a negatively charged gluta- mate that can stabilize the oxacarbenium. It remains problematic that any water molecule in the vicinity of an oxacarbenium ion would be expected to react immediately, thereby aborting the subsequent steps that lead to lysine deacetylation.

Structural Insights into Enzyme Mechanism
the Proposals for the structural basis of NAD+-dependent deacetylation reaction have come from several different studies of sirtuins bound to substrates and products. As mentioned above, isotope-labeling experi- ments suggest that the deacetylation reaction begins with cleavage of the nicotinamide glycosidic bond and an attack by the carbonyl oxygen of acetyllysine on the C1(cid:2) of the nicotinamide ribose (109). Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed for the nicotinamide step of the reaction. A dissocia- tive, SN1-like reaction has been proposed on the basis of the structure of a ternary complex containing yeast Hst2, acetylated peptide, and carba-NAD+, a nonreactive analog that contains cyclopentane in place of the nicoti- namide ribose (123). In that structure, the acetyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to the 2(cid:2)- and 3(cid:2)-hydroxyls of the nicotinamide ribose. The orientation of the ribose does not allow access by the acetyl oxygen to the C1(cid:2) of the ribose, thereby precluding a direct nucleophilic attack. Instead, Zhao and colleagues (123) propose that a highly ordered water in the vicinity of the ribose stabilizes formation of a
An associative, SN2-like reaction mecha- nism was proposed on the basis of the struc- ture of Sir2Af2 bound to NAD+ and an acetyllysine mimic, polyethylene glycol (118). In this structure, the nicotinamide ribose adopts a different conformation from that of the cyclopentane of carba-NAD+. Impor- tantly,thesugarringisorientedwithitsαface exposedtotheacetyloxygen,whichcouldper- mit a direct nucleophilic attack by the acetyl oxygen on the C1(cid:2) of the ribose. Burial of the charged nicotinamide ring in a largely hy- drophobic environment and rotation of the carboxamide ring out of plane would decrease the energetic barrier to cleaving the glyco- sidic bond. However, the oxygen of the amide is still a very weak nucleophile, and an SN2

competitive inhibitor by reacting with the enzyme-bound O-alkylimidate intermediate, reforming NAD+ and releasing the acety- lated peptide in a base-exchange reaction (103, 104). As shown in structural studies of the Sir2Af2 and Sir2Tm enzymes (119), free nicotinamide can bind in the C pocket when the enzyme is simultaneously in complex with peptide, ADP-ribose, or NAD+ that is in a nonproductive conformation, thereby leav- ing the C pocket free to bind nicotinamide (Figure 10). The carboxamide of free nicoti- namide forms the same hydrogen bonds with the enzyme as when NAD+ binds in the pro- ductive conformation. However, the ring in free nicotinamide adopts the low-energy con- formation (125, 126) and is nearly coplanar with the carboxamide. While the hydrogen- bonding interactions anchor the carboxamide totheenzyme,theringisabletoadoptanum- ber of different conformations. It has been suggested that only a subset of the conforma- tions of nicotinamide bound in the C pocket are in a position to react with the O-alkyl imi- date intermediate (119). The relevance of the C pocket to the inhibitory base-exchange re- actionissupportedbyexperimentsonSir2Tm enzyme in which the invariant C pocket, as- partic acid, in which hydrogen bonds with the amino group of nicotinamide, is changed to asparagine. This substitution enables the mu- tant to catalyze the inhibitory base-exchange reaction with nicotinic acid, which does not inhibit the wild-type enzyme. The glutamic acid to glutamine substitution also enables the enzyme to catalyze NAAD+-dependent deacetylation, indicating that the C pocket plays dual roles in deacetylation and base exchange.
mechanism for an ADP-ribosyl transferase would be unprecendented, as all other re- action coordinates of this type involve SN1 mechanisms with migration of the ribosyl cation. A more recent structure of a ternary complex containing wild-type Sir2Tm bound to NAD+ and acetylated peptide (K. Hoff, J. Avalos, K. Sens, and C. Wolberger, manuscript submitted) provides further in- sights into the true nature of the Michaelis complex. As in the structure of Sir2Af2 with NAD+ and an acetyllysine mimic, the ribose isorientedwithitsαfaceexposedtotheacetyl oxygen, although the absolute ribose confor- mation is somewhat different from that in the PEG complex. The distance between the acetyl oxygen and the C1(cid:2) is 3.2 ˚A, as pre- dicted for nucleophilic displacement by elec- trophile migration, but somewhat long for an SN2-like nucleophilic attack. The ribose 2(cid:2)- and 3(cid:2)-hydroxyls hydrogen bond to the acetyl oxygen, albeit in a different relative orientation from that observed in the carba- NAD+ structure (123). Additionl hydrogen bonds between the 2(cid:2)- and 3(cid:2)-hydroxyls of the nicotinamideriboseandthecatalytichistidine (His116 in Sir2Tm) may further help to posi- tion NAD+ in a conformation that is primed for catalysis. In particular, the proximal phos- phate oxygen is within van der Waals contact distance (3.1–3.7 ˚A) of several of the ribose atoms, which could help stabilize a develop- ingnegativechargeonthe ribosepredictedby anSN1mechanism.Followingcleavageofthe glycosidic bond, the catalytic histidine would needtoremainwithinhydrogen-bondingdis- tance of the 3(cid:2)-hydroxyl in order to carry out the proposed deprotonation of the ribose and promote the rearrangements that lead to mi- gration of the acetyl group from the C1(cid:2) to the 2(cid:2) and 3(cid:2) positions (Figure 6). Indeed, the same hydrogen bond with the ribose is seen in the structure of Hst2 bound to the prod- uct, O-AADPR (64), suggesting that this in- teraction could be maintained throughout the deacetylation reaction.
Multimerization of Sirtuins
There is evidence that at least one sirtuin, yeast Hst2, may regulate its own activity by homo-oligomerization. Crystals of the Hst2 apoenzyme contain crystallographic trimers that arise from contacts with neighboring monomers made by N- and C-terminal

residues that lie outside the conserved sir- tuin core (64). A seven-residue amino acid extension binds in the substrate binding inserting cleft of a neighboring molecule, the N-terminal methionine into the acetylly- sine binding tunnel, while an additional C- terminal helix not found in other sirtuins me- diates additional contacts with the catalytic domain. Hst2 forms trimers in solution with a dissociation constant that falls roughly in the physiological range of Hst2 concentration, suggesting that the crystallographic trimer may also be relevant in the cell. Trimeriza- tion is dependent upon the presence of the seven-residue amino acid extension. The po- tential signiﬁcance of the observed interac- tion is that the N-terminal residues inhibit enzymatic activity, raising the Km for peptide by approximately twofold, whereas the addi- tional C-terminal residues raise the Km for NAD+ by approximately twofold. This pro- vides a potential auto-inhibitory mechanism, which can be exploited by the cell to acti- vate Hst2, by either competing for the in- hibitory N-terminal peptide or binding to an- otherproteinthatrelievestheinhibitoryeffect of the C-terminal helix. Most sirtuins contain additional residues or domains ﬂanking the catalytic domain that could similarly autoreg- ulate enzymatic activity.
Resveratrol and plant polyphenols. The polyphenol sirtuin activators were discovered through a high-throughput screen using a ﬂuorophore-linked peptide substrate as a re- action reporter. This screen used low concen- trations of the ﬂuorophore-linked substrate and also used low NAD+ concentrations with SirT1 as the enzyme. These conditions were designed so that compounds that provide ac- tivation could be discovered. A set of well- known polyphenol compounds with known biological and anti-oxidant activities scored high in this assay. Among these compounds were resveratrol, quercetin, and a set of other known catechins produced by plants such as tea and grapes (resveratrol is abundant in red wine). The activation effects of these com- pounds in the assay were two- to eightfold, with the best activation observed for resvera- trol. Kinetic studies indicated that resveratrol reduced Km values for substrates (by two- to eightfold), most notably for peptides. Subse- quent studies of the biological responses of cells treated with resveratrol showed effects consistent with stimulation of SirT1 activity. These effects included increased resistance of cells to apoptosis (10), reduced adipoge- nesis in fat-producing cells (consistent with SirT1 antagonism of PPARγ) (12), and in- creasedstressresistanceofneuronsinaSirT1- dependent mechanism (16). Problematic to resveratrol is a lack of speciﬁcity for SirT1 in vivo, as the compound is unstable in cells to oxidation (127) and is also a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenases and other enzymes (127). This lack of speciﬁcity complicates interpre- tation of the effects observed for resveratrol in cells.
SMALL MOLECULE MODULATORS OF SIRTUINS
A number of small molecule agents have been identiﬁed that either inhibit or activate sir- tuin enzymes. These chemical reagents have been utilized to examine the biological activi- ties of sirtuins in diverse organisms including yeast, ﬂies, and mammals. Examples of these molecules are brieﬂy described.
Activators of Sirtuins
Small molecule activators of enzymes are uncommon, but two distinct examples have been found for sirtuins. These activators in-

compound includes an imine function con- structed from 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde condensed with an aromatic amine. This derivative is a micromolar inhibitor of the yeast Sir2p enzyme and is also a potent in- hibitor of the human sirtuin SirT2 (128). There is no evidence for inhibition of SirT1. It is not clear where sirtinols bind on Sir2 enzymes.
substrates do not contain a ﬂuorophore are problematic for this intriguing molecule as an activatorofsirtuins(83,84).Twoindependent laboratories investigated resveratrol activity in activating SirT1 activity for peptide sub- strates analogous to those used in the original assays with and without ﬂuorophore. These studiesshowedthatﬂuorophorepeptideshave signiﬁcantly higher Km values than the under- ivatized peptides in the absence of resveratrol, leading to the conclusion that resveratrol sta- bilizes binding of these modiﬁed substrates to the enzyme. Underivatized peptides did not bind better in the presence of resveratrol, so no activation effects were observed with these more physiologic substrates (83, 84). Given that resveratrol effects in vivo are consistent with potent SirT1 activation, these in vitro results suggest that the mechanism of resver- atrol (and other polyphenols) and its physio- logic impact on SirT1 activity is poorly un- derstood.
Splitomicins. Like splitomicins were among the ﬁrst compounds identiﬁed in a library screening to discover disrup- tors of gene silencing in yeast (129). Both sirtinol and splitomicins incorporate a 1,2- substituted-napthalene nucleus as a central feature of the molecule. Splitomicins also have a third fused lactone ring (129–131). The parent molecule is partially saturated and inhibits Sir2 speciﬁcally. The compound dehydrosplitomicin exhibits speciﬁcity for the sirtuin Hst1p and is a very weak inhibitor of Sir2p (130, 131). This latter compound has been used to show that the Hst1p enzyme regulates NAD+ biosynthesis in yeast (124). Splitomicin and dehydrosplitomicin are not potentinhibitorsofhumansirtuins.However, a splitomicin-like compound called HR73 was recently reported to inhibit human SirT1 (95). A full characterization of the inhibitory properties of this compound against SirT1 has not been reported.

Inhibitors of Sirtuins
Several inhibitors of the sirtuin enzymes have been discovered. The most available is the product molecule nicotinamide. Problematic to the use of this compound as an inhibitor is the ability of nicotinamide to be directly in- corporated into metabolism. In addition, all sirtuins studied thus far exhibit some sensitiv- ity to nicotinamide inhibition. Thus, nicoti- namideislikelytoinhibitallsirtuinsinacellor organism to some extent. This consequence is likely to cause difﬁculty attributing a biologi- cal effect to the speciﬁc interaction of nicoti- namide with a given sirtuin target. The need for speciﬁc sirtuin inhibitors and the charac- terization of their effects on individual sirtuin enzymes is apparent.
CONCLUSION
The comparative lack of speciﬁc and po- tent inhibitors of mammalian sirtuin enzymes posesanobstacletoourunderstandingoftheir activities in cells. The use of sirtinol and split- omicin in studies investigating sirtuin action in mammalian cells raises concerns because theactionsiteshavenotbeendetermined,and there is no evidence that they potently inhibit SirT1. These issues highlight the need for ad- ditional efforts to discover inhibitors that tar- get this intriguing class of enzymes (132).
