Small ubiquitin like modiﬁer (SUMO) proteins are known to regulate many important cellular processes such as transcription and apoptosis. Recently, hybrid SUMO-ubiquitin chains containing SUMO-2 linked to
Lys63-di-ubiquitin were found to play a major role in DNA repair. Despite some progress in understanding the role of these hybrid chains in DNA repair, there are various fundamental questions

DNA repair, the homogenous material of these chains, and their unique analogues, are needed in workable quantities. By applying advanced chemical strategies for protein synthesis, we report the ﬁrst total chemical synthesis of four diﬀerent SUMO-2-Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin hybrid chains, in which the di-ubiquitin is linked to diﬀerent lysines in SUMO. In these syntheses, the usefulness of removable solubilizing tags is demonstrated, and two diﬀerent approaches were examined in terms of reliability and eﬃciency. In the ﬁrst approach, a poly-Arg tag was attached to the C-terminus of SUMO via a 3,4- in the second we attached the tag via diaminobenzoic acid cleavable linker, whereas linker, which can be cleaved by PdCl2. The comparison between these a phenylacetamidomethyl diﬀerent strategies oﬀers guidelines for future scale-up preparation of these analogues and other proteins, which currently use synthetic peptide intermediates that are diﬃcult to handle and purify. The availability of the SUMO-ubiquitin hybrid chains opens up new opportunities for studying the role of

these chains in DNA repair and other cellular processes.
Introduction
The covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins to lysines in substrate proteins regulates a vast array of cellular processes.1,2 Ubiquitin is an 8.5 kDa, 76-amino acid protein, whereas the small ubiquitin-like modier (SUMO) proteins have molecular weight (cid:1)10 kDa and exist as four iso- forms known as SUMO-1/2/3/4. SUMOylation regulates essential cellular processes transcription, mitochondrial dynamics and the DNA damage response.1,2 Analogous to ubiquitination, SUMOylation is also mediated by the E1, E2 and E3 enzymes, which catalyze formation of an isopeptide bond between the SUMO C-terminal Gly and the epsilon amino group of a Lys residue in a target protein. Like poly-ubiquitin chains, poly-SUMO-2/3 chains are also found in cells, where one SUMO

is connected via its C-terminus to a Lys that is present in the consensus motif JKXD/E (where J represents a large hydro- phobic residue and X any amino acids) of the preceding SUMO. It was initially believed that SUMO and Ub were independent in their homotypic signaling. However, mass spectrometry studies revealed the presence of ubiquitinated SUMO in cells,3 indicating the presence of mixed SUMO-ubiquitin polymers. More recently, hybrid chains consisting of Lys63-linked poly- ubiquitin conjugated to SUMO-2 chains were shown to play a role in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by recruiting the BRCA1-A complex4 subunit RAP80. This subunit of the BRCA1-A complex was previously known to bind specically to Lys63- linked di-Ub,5,6 and it was shown to also contain a SUMO- interacting motif, suggesting that RAP80 recognizes both ubiquitin and SUMO. Indeed, a hybrid chain containing Lys63- di-Ub linked to SUMO-2 binds 80-fold more tightly to RAP80 than SUMO-2 or Lys63-di-Ub alone.4 The enhanced aﬃnity of the hybrid chain to RAP80 is mediated by the tandem SUMO interacting motif and the tandem ubiquitin interacting motifs present in RAP80.7

eight possible lysines in SUMO-2 to which ubiquitin can be conjugated (Lys5, Lys7, Lys11, Lys21, Lys33, Lys35, Lys42 and Lys 45), in addition to the SUMO N-terminus (Met1),8 yet it is not known which SUMO-ubiquitin linkage might be optimal for eﬃcient binding to RAP80. Furthermore, the three dimensional structural topologies of the diﬀerent types of hybrid chains are uncharacterized. Since additional proteins containing SUMO- interacting motifs in proximity to ubiquitin-binding motifs have been identied,4 it is possible that proteins other than RAP80 may also recognize hybrid chains in DNA damage or in other cellular events. At least one deubiquitinating enzyme has been identied that specically removes ubiquitin from SUMO,9 although it is not known whether there are additional enzymes specic for the hybrid chains that could also potentially discriminate among the diﬀerent chain types.
In order to investigate these important questions, homoge- nous material consisting of hybrid chains in workable quanti- ties is needed. While hybrid chains containing ubiquitin fused to the N-terminus of SUMO can be prepared enzymatically,4,8 until this work the other hybrid chains remained inaccessible. Moreover, the probes and unique analogues based on these hybrid chains are oen not easy or even possible to prepare by enzymatic approaches. Chemical synthesis should in principle overcome these challenges and make it possible to prepare a desired hybrid chain and its desired analogues. While the synthesis of native SUMO-1/2/3 using ligation approaches10–12 and SUMO-linked to Ubc9 via a triazole bond has been ach- ieved,13 the synthesis of hybrid chains remains inaccessible. We report here for rst time the preparation of four diﬀerent SUMO-2-Lys63-linked-di-Ub analogues by employing current state of the art chemical methods for protein synthesis.14 In

these syntheses, we encountered major problems in the handling and purication of synthetic peptide intermediates, which gave rise to ineﬃciencies. To overcome these problems, we examined various synthetic strategies to assist in these syntheses, mainly the use of two methods for attaching solu- bilizing tags at diﬀerent positions in SUMO to facilitate synthesis. This approach enabled us to compare the reliability of these methods and select the most eﬃcient one for future synthesis.
Results and discussion
We previously demonstrated the total chemical- and semi- synthesis of diﬀerent ubiquitin conjugates with increasing complexity, such as free tetra-Ub chains,15 doubly modied H2B histone with glycan and Ub units,16 and tetra-ubiquitinated proteins.17–19 This has facilitated biochemical, biophysical and functional analyses of these conjugates.18–20 Equipped with various synthetic tools for protein synthesis of such complex conjugates, we decided to examine the total chemical synthesis

of SUMO-2 linked to Lys63-di-Ub via its N-terminus, di-Ub(K63)- SUMO-2 (1, Scheme 1), using a convergent approach. Towards this goal, we strategically divided the 93 amino acids of SUMO-2 into two fragments, Thz-SUMO(2-45)-SR, 2, (Thz: thiazolidine) and Cys-SUMO(47-93)C49S, 3, (Scheme 1). The N-terminal Met was mutated to Thz to enable ligation with Ub and Ala46 was mutated to Cys to facilitate native chemical ligation (NCL).21 As shown in Scheme 1, this Cys residue is converted to alanine during the desulfurization reaction, thus restoring the native sequence. The native Cys49 was mutated to Ser, which is structurally closer to Cys, to prevent its conversion to Ala during desulfurization in the later stage of the synthesis. Fragment 2 was synthesized using Fmoc-SPPS and an N-acylurea approach followed by thiolysis aer peptide deprotection and cleavage from the resin.22 Fragment 3 was also synthesized employing Fmoc-SPPS. This fragment exhibited anomalous behavior in the HPLC purication step, but despite this we were able to successfully obtain the fragment in 8% isolated yield. Having both fragments in hand, we then carried out the ligation reac- tion, followed by Thz conversion to Cys to obtain Cys-SUMO(2-

This was followed by switching the C-terminal N-methyl-Cys to the corresponding thioester of 3-mercapto propionic acid (MPA), 6a, as we previously reported for the synthesis of Lys48- linked di-Ub.15 We then attempted nal ligation between Cys- SUMO(2-93) 4 and di-Ub(K63*)-COSR 6a. However, we did not observe product formation even aer 24 h incubation, likely due to the poor solubility of di-Ub(K63*)-COSR in the ligation buﬀer.

We then moved to examine a sequential ligation strategy. We synthetized Ub(K63*)-COSR analogue, 5, employing the N- methyl-Cys approach25 and subjected it to ligation with frag- ment 4. Subsequently, d-mercaptolysine in Ub was deprotected to furnish Ub(K63*)-Cys-SUMO(2-93), 6, in 28% yield. This was then ligated with Ub-COSR, 7, to give di-Ub(K63*)-Cys-SUMO(2- 93). A nal one-pot desulfurization27 was then performed to produce the desired diUb(K63)-Ala-SUMO(2-93), 1, in 23% yield (ESI S23†).
It is important to mention that, in this synthesis, the rst ligation between fragments 4 and 5 and the subsequent mer- captolysine deprotection proceeded smoothly, which is clearly evident from analytical HPLC and mass analysis of these reac- tions. However, the HPLC purication process of the resultant ligation product 6 was very challenging, as we observed drag- ging of the product—eluting over (cid:1)10 min—which led to an overlap of the impurities and the desired product being ob- tained in a very low yield (ESI S20†). In addition, we reen- countered the same purication problem while isolating the di- Ub(K63)-Ala1-SUMO 1 conjugate. Although this approach was successful in obtaining the nal product, the low yield of the nal product (<2%) and the diﬃculties in the purication steps make it very diﬃcult to apply in the synthesis of the analogue and other analogues based on the hybrid chains.
We speculated that the peptide behaviors in HPLC analysis and purication might be due to the hydrophobic nature of the synthetic intermediates and decided to install a removable solubilizing tag in fragment 3 during SPPS. This could in principle increase the solubility, lower the dragging of the peptide fragments, and ease the handling and purication of the intermediates and nal conjugate. A variety of methods have been developed to aid the synthesis of hydrophobic proteins or those whose synthetic intermediates are diﬃcult to purify and use in the ligation.28–33 In considering this problem, we were inspired by the recent work of Liu and coworkers, in which the 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid (Dbz) linker22 was employed to attach a poly-Arg tag to the C-terminus of a hydrophobic peptide fragment to increase its solubility in the ligation buﬀer, and assist in its purication.34 Subsequently, the Dbz linked to the (Arg)6 tag was switched to the thioester by treatment with sodium nitrite followed by thiolysis with exogenous thiol to enable the next ligation. We also chose to utilize the Dbz linker to install an (Arg)6 tag at the C-terminus of Cys-SUMO(47-93) hoping to control the anomalous behavior of this fragment during the preparative HPLC purication and improve the overall yield. We also hoped this would ease the handling of the SUMO-Ub conjugates in the purication steps. In our case, the tag could be removed by converting the Dbz into the more reactive triazole intermediate followed by hydrolysis.
We rst attempted the synthesis of a model peptide bearing a Dbz linked (Arg)6 tag at the SUMO C-terminus, SUMO(49-93)- 10, using allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) protection on the Dbz-(Arg)6 Dbz during SPPS. Aer peptide elongation, the alloc protection was removed and the peptide was cleaved from the resin to obtain 10. The mass analysis of the reaction mixture showed two masses of 6262.2 Da and 6244.1 Da in a ratio of 78 : 22 (ESI S25†). We presumed that under strong acidic conditions, the

free amine of the Dbz might have condensed with the carbonyl of the less sterically hindered C-terminal Gly to give a SUMO- (49-92)-NHCH2-benzimidazole side product 11 with a mass of 6244.1 Da (Scheme 2). This assumption was further supported by analyzing the resulting mixture of the removal step of the Dbz-(Arg)6 tag. Upon treatment with 60 equiv. of NaNO2 at (cid:3)15 (cid:4)C for 10 minutes we observed the formation of a benzo- triazole intermediate 12. Extending the reaction for an extra hour at the same temperature provided a mixture containing SUMO(49-91)-piperazine-2,5-dione 13, the desired hydrolyzed product SUMO(49-93)-COOH 14 and the unreacted 11 (ESI S27†). We reasoned that, since the peptide benzotriazole 12 is it spontaneously undergoes hydrolysis and highly reactive, intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the amide of the subse- quent Gly on the activated C-terminus, also leading to the formation of piperazine-2,5-dione 13.
To control the formation of the benzimidazole side product 11, we synthesized SUMO(49-93)-Dbz-(Arg)6 while protecting the free amine with a propargyloxycarbonyl (Proc) group. The peptide was cleaved from the resin with subsequent removal of 24 on the crude peptide in Gn$HCl to the Proc group using PdCl2
10 without the formation of any obtain SUMO(49-93)-Dbz-(Arg)6 side products. The Proc group was chosen instead of Alloc for in aqueous solution using protection because its removal palladium is much more eﬃcient. to avoid piperazine-2,5-dione 13 formation, we chose to use mercap- toethanol in this reaction that could rapidly form a thioester by intercepting the benzotriazole intermediate 12. To our delight, adding an excess of mercaptoethanol to the benzotriazole 12, and continuing the reaction for an additional hour, led to the quantitative formation of the thioester, SUMO(49-93)-COSCH2- CH2OH. Subsequent elevation of the reaction pH to 9,35 while keeping it for an additional hour at room temperature, provided the desired SUMO(49-93)-COOH, (ESI, S30†).
In addition,
Encouraged by these results with the model peptide, we then implemented this approach for the synthesis of di-Ub(K63)-Ala- SUMO(2-93). We rst synthesized Cys-SUMO(47-93)-Dbz-(Arg)6 15 and ligated it with fragment 2, which was followed by Thz 16 (Scheme 3). At removal to obtain Cys-SUMO(2-93)-Dbz-(Arg)6 this stage of this work, and in a parallel project, we discovered the eﬃcient removal of Thz by palladium complexes,24 hence we began to employ Pd[(allyl)Cl]2 for Thz removal instead of the

The next ligation with 7 also proceeded smoothly, and subsequent desulfurization aﬀorded 8, which upon the removal of the solubilizing tag, and when employing the above established conditions, aﬀorded the desired product 9 in 2–3% overall yield (Fig. 1) starting from fragment 15.

Although the incorporation of a Dbz based solubilizing tag assisted in isolating the SUMO and SUMO-Ub conjugates, the key 15 was obtained in very fragment Cys-SUMO(47-93)-Dbz-(Arg)6 low yield ((cid:1)6%). In addition, the requirement for multiple steps to remove the tag rendered this approach low yielding and operationally diﬃcult, in particular when dealing with small- scale synthesis. This prompted us to search for other alterna- tive approaches for enhancing the solubility of the peptide frag- ments. During the course of validating the applicability of a Dbz based solubilizing tag, our laboratory has invented a phenyl- (Phacm) based removable solubilizing tag acetamidomethyl applicable to protein synthesis.28 This newly developed linker is stable under SPPS and NCL conditions and can be cleaved quantitatively using PdCl2 aer completing the synthesis of the target protein. Therefore, we decided to examine the eﬀect of the Phacm based solubilizing tag in the synthesis of di-Ub(K63)-Ala- SUMO(2-93) 1. One obvious advantage of this approach is the opportunity to distribute the solubilizing tag along the poly- peptide sequence, in contrast with the previous method, which is mainly limited to the C-terminus. We therefore wondered if installing the two Phacm linked solubilizing tags across the SUMO chain would improve the behavior of the SUMO-Ub conjugates during purication and the overall yield.
To examine this approach, we synthesized two SUMO frag- ments, Cys-SUMO-(47-93), harboring a solubilizing tag, where Ala 23 and 74 will be con- verted temporarily to Alloc protected Phacm [abbreviated as Thz-SUMO-(2-45 A23C*)-COSR, 18 and Cys-SUMO-(47-93 A74C*), 19], as shown in Scheme 4. Both fragments were ob- tained in good yields and purity when employing SPPS (ESI†). Notably, while in the previous approach fragment 15 was diﬃ- cult to obtain in good yield, the equivalent fragment 19 was eﬃciently prepared and isolated in (cid:1)10% yield compared to 6% for fragment 15. Having the two fragments in hand, we then proceeded with NCL, followed by Thz opening with MeONH2 to obtain Cys-SUMO-(2-93, A23C*, A74C*) 20. Subsequent ligation with 5 and Thz-opening provided Ub(K63*)-Cys-SUMO-(2-93, A23C*, A74C*) 21. Gratifyingly, with this strategy we achieved complete control of the dragging of the peptide during puri- cation and obtained the resultant conjugate in very good yield and high purity. This is also clearly evident from the compar- ison of the preparative HPLC patterns of the Ub(K63*)-SUMO conjugate with and without tags (ESI, S53†). Further, di-Ub- (K63*)-Cys-SUMO(2-93, A23C*, A74C*) 22 was obtained from the ligation between 21 and 7.

Subsequently, the two Phacm linked solubilizing tags were removed quantitatively bytreatingwithPdCl2 inGn$HClbuﬀerat pH 7 for 2 h (Fig. 2). The reaction was quenched with an excess of DTT, dialyzed against Gn$HCl at pH 7, and subjected to desul- furization to produce the desired product 1 in 39% yield and 6% overall yield starting from fragment 19 (ESI, S51†), which is two- fold better compared to synthesis based on the Dbz tag. We successfully applied a similar strategy to synthesize di-Ub(K63)- Lys11-SUMO-2, di-Ub(K63)-Lys33-SUMO-2 di-Ub(K63)- Lys42-SUMO-2. These analogues were then folded in Tris buﬀer solution of pH (cid:1) 7.3 and their secondary structures were exam- ined by circular dichroism, which suggested correct folding of

these chains (ESI, S54†). We are currently building on our opti- mized synthetic approach to prepare workable quantities of these chains and use them in a variety of biochemical, proteomic and structural studies, which will be reported in due course.
In summary, we have accomplished total chemical synthesis of four diﬀerent di-Ub(K63)-SUMO-2 analogues. During our attempts at synthesis, major handling and purication problems were encountered, which forced us to attach poly-Arg tag(s) to SUMO to assist in overcoming these obstacles. Two strategies were exam- ined, in the rst approach a poly-Arg tag was attached to the C- terminus of SUMO via a Dbz-cleavable linker. In the second approach, we attached the poly-Arg tags via the newly developed Phacm linker, which is cleaved by PdCl2 upon completion of the synthesis. Although both were successful in overcoming theabove- described challenges, the approach based on the Phacm linker turned out to be more eﬃcient and reliable, and it required fewer steps. The current study and the developed synthetic approaches open new horizons for studying the role of the hybrid chains in DNA repair and should enable studies that otherwise are diﬃcult or impossible to conduct. Moreover, the synthetic lessons learned here should assist in the synthesis of other challenging proteins.
