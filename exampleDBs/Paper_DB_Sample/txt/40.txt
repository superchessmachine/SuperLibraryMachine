Abstract
Post-translational modification of histones plays a central role in regulating transcription. Methylation of histone H3 at lysines 4 (H3K4) and 79 (H3K79) play roles in activating transcription whereas methylation of H3K27 is a repressive mark. These modifications, in turn, depend upon prior monoubiquitination of specific histone residues in a phenomenon known as histone crosstalk. Earlier work had provided insights into the mechanism by which monoubiquitinated of histone H2BK120 stimulates H3K4 methylation by COMPASS/MLL1 and H3K79 methylation by DOT1L, and monoubiquitinated H2AK119 stimulates methylation of H3K27 by the PRC2 complex. Recent studies have shed new light on the role of individual subunits and paralogs in regulating the activity of PRC2 and how additional post-translational modifications regulate yeast Dot1 and human DOT1L, as well as provided new insights into the regulation of MLL1 by H2BK120Ub.
Introduction
The regulation of eukaryotic transcription depends upon dynamic and reversible post- translational modification of the four core histones, which package genomic DNA into chromatin. This spatiotemporal regulation is governed by an intricate code of histone modifications, which range from small chemical modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, up to the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, which plays a non-degradative role in regulating transcription. Histone modifications alter the charge or structural dynamics of a histone sidechain [1] in addition to recruiting enzyme complexes containing domains that specifically recognize the modification. In an added layer of regulation, known as histone-crosstalk, a modification of one histone influences the subsequent modification of another, forming a type of signaling cascade.

Crosstalk between histone ubiquitination and methylation plays well-characterized roles in both gene activation and repression. Monoubiquitinated histone H2AK119 (H2AK119ub) is highly enriched in transcriptionally silent regions of chromatin [2], while monoubiquitinated histone H2BK120 (H2BK120ub) is found in actively transcribed regions [3]. H2AK119ub stimulates methylation of histone H3K27, a repressive mark, while H2BK120ub (in humans; K123 in yeast) stimulates methylation of histone H3K4 and H3K79, two modifications that are hallmarks of actively transcribed chromatin. Up to three methyl groups can be conjugated to the Nζ of lysine, with mono-, di-, and tri-methylated lysine (me1, me2, me3) in some cases playing distinct roles [4]. The first structural studies to shed light on the mechanism of cross-talk revealed how H2BK120/123ub stimulated methylation of histone H3K4 by yeast COMPASS and of H3K79 by human DOT1L [5]. More recent work has provided the first insights into the mechanism by which H2AK119ub stimulates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to methylate H3K27 [6]. Here, we discuss how new structural studies of the human H3K4 methyltransferase, MLL1, as well of yeast and human H3K79 methyltransferases, Dot1 and DOT1L, have provided important new insights into the multiple roles H2BK120ub plays in the cascade of activating histone marks [7].
AEBP2 and JARID2 recognition of H2AK119ub increases methyltransferase
activity of PRC2
Tri-methylation of histone H3K27 is responsible for transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction of Polycomb target genes [8], which play essential roles in cell differentiation and development [9]. First identified in Drosophila mutants displaying homeotic transformations, the Polycomb Group (PcG) genes were found to encode two multisubunit enzymes, Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2) [9]. These complexes regulate multiple genes required for lineage commitment during embryonic development and for maintaining cell identity in all metazoans [10]. PRC1 is a heterodimeric E3 ligase that monoubiquitinates histone H2AK119 via its Ring1B and Bmi1 subunits and is a therapeutic target due to its involvement in cancer [11,12]. H2AK119ub, in turn, is required for trimethylation of H3K27me3 by PRC2 [13], a multiprotein complex containing Set-family methyltransferase, EZH1 or EZH2 [14]. The PRC2 core complex comprises four core proteins: EZH1/2, EED, SUZ12, and RBAP46/48 [15]. Whereas the PRC2-core complex is a weak enzyme on its own, inclusion of the AEBP2 and JARID2 subunits in the complex increases PRC2 methyltransferase activity nearly five-fold [16,17]. While H2AK119ub was known to be essential for PRC2 mediated transcriptional repression by promoting H3K27 methylation [13,18], the direct molecular mechanism underlying the cross-talk between these two histone modifications was not, until recently, fully understood.
The cryo-EM structure of a complete PRC2-core complex with AEBP2 and JARID2 bound to a H2AK119ub nucleosome was determined to a resolution of 3.5 Å (Figure 1A) [6]. AEBP2 and JARID2 were shown to recognize H2AK119ub, thereby recruiting PRC2 and facilitating the activation of the EZH2 methyltransferase subunit. On one face of the nucleosome, JARID2 contacts ubiquitin via its ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM), while several lysine/arginine residues contact the nucleosome acidic patch. On the opposite face of the nucleosome, two of AEBP2’s three zinc fingers interact with ubiquitin as well as

with acidic and hydrophobic residues on the H2A-H2B surface (Figure 1A). Together, JARID2 and AEBP2 anchor PRC2 to the H2AK119ub-modified nucleosome, stabilizing the PRC2-core complex in a conformation near its methylation target in the H3 tail. With the PRC2-core complex stabilized, the SET and CXC domains of EZH2 bind the H2AK119ub- modified nucleosome and the nucleosomal DNA further interacts with the KRR motif of AEBP2, agreeing with previous studies that hypothesized this interaction [17,19]. Between EZH2 and the H3 tail, a composite interface composed of a network of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions is formed, stabilizing an otherwise unstructured area. This, in turn, allows H3K27 to be positioned in the catalytic pocket of the EZH2 SET domain, providing the structural basis for SET methylation of H3K27 in the context of H2AK119ub (Figure 1B). The presence of JARID2 and AEBP2 is doubly important in the context of the transcriptionally activating marks, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, as the interactions of these proteins with H2AK119ub relieves the inhibitory effects of these methyl marks and allows EZH2 to methylate H3K27 [6].
Divergent roles of EZH1 and EZH2 in PRC2 complexes
In mammals, there are two forms of the PRC2 complex that differ in the inclusion of either EZH2 or its paralog EZH1, a gene putatively created through a duplication event [14]. Whereas EZH2 has been found to be essential in embryonic development, with homozygous deletions resulting in embryonic lethality, EZH1 null mice are viable and fertile [20]. In addition, EZH1 plays a role in adult tissues, such as maintaining hematopoietic stem cells [21,22]. Another difference between the two paralogs stems from their differing oligomerization properties. Recent crystal structures have shown PRC2 dimerizes through its SUZ12 domain, and that phosphorylation of SUZ12 by CK2 promotes PRC2 function by stabilizing the SET catalytic site for H3K27 methylation [23,24]. Interestingly, while PRC2:EZH1 dimerizes, its H3K27 methylation activity is substantially weaker than that of PRC2:EZH2 and reportedly represses transcription through an alternative mechanism linked to chromatin compaction [24,25].
A recent structural investigation of PRC2:EZH1 [26] further explored the functional differences between EZH1 and EZH2. The authors reported cryo-EM structures [26] of monomeric PRC2:EZH1 and of a PRC2:EZH1 dimer bound to a nucleosome containing an H3K27M substitution, an oncohistone mutation that drives tighter binding to nucleosomes (Figure 1C & Figure 1D) [27]. PRC2 cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2 were also present, and the nucleosome also contained ubiquitin conjugated to H2AK119, although none of these proteins could be resolved in the maps. The authors found that PRC2:EZH1 undergoes a marked conformational rearrangement to form a nucleosome-bound dimer (Figure 1D). A divergent EZH1/2 loop denoted MS2L [26] that contacts the DNA was found to be responsible for mediating tighter chromatin binding by PRC2:EZH1 and promoted greater chromatin compaction as compared to PRC2:EZH2. This divergent loop was also found to be partly responsible for PRC2:EZH1’s attenuated methyltransferase activity.

Recent structural advances in MLL1-nucleosome complex formation
Methylation of histone H3K4 is a mark of actively transcribed chromatin that is recognized by specific domains within a variety of transcription factors that activate transcription. Roles of H3K4 methylation include stimulating histone H3 acetylation by the Gcn5 acetyltransferase subunit of SAGA [28] and recruiting nucleosome remodeling enzymes, Chd1 [29]and NURF [30]. The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) proteins, which include MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, SET1A, and SET1B, are KMT2 family methyltransferases that methylate histone H3K4, which is highly enriched at promoters and distal regulatory enhancers in humans [31]. MLL proteins play vital roles during hematopoiesis, adipogenesis, and embryogenesis, and are among the most highly mutated genes in human cancers, making them attractive therapeutic targets [32–34]. The MLL1 core complex, composed of full length RBBP5, WDR5, ASH2L, DPY30, and a C-terminal fragment of MLL1 containing the SET methyltransferase domain, is stimulated by the ubiquitination of histone H2BK120 (H2Bub) [35]. Previous cryo-EM investigations revealed the overall topology of the MLL1 complex bound to unmodified and H2Bub-modified nucleosomes [35,36]. While the MLL1 complex was found to bind to unmodified nucleosomes in two dramatically different orientations, binding modes 1 and 2, the MLL1 complex bound to the H2Bub nucleosome solely in binding mode 1 [35,36]. Despite these advances, the relative contribution of binding modes 1 and 2 to MLL1 activity remained unclear [35–38].
Three recent studies have expanded our understanding of the structure and activity of the MLL1 complex on a nucleosome [39–41]. Ayoub et al. [39] determined the cryo-EM structure of the MLL1 complex bound to a nucleosome containing an H3K4M substitution, a mutation known to promote tight binding of SET domain methyltransferases [42]. As in prior studies, binding modes 1 and 2 were observed (Figure 2A & Figure 2B) [39]. To probe the significance of each binding mode, Ayoub et al. disrupted the interfaces between the MLL1 complex and nucleosome corresponding to each binding mode and measured the activity of MLL1 [39]. Disruption of binding mode 2, but not binding mode 1, led to a decrease in MLL1 activity on unmodified nucleosomes, leading the authors to postulate that binding mode 2 is the active MLL1 complex conformation [39]. These results are difficult to reconcile with the observation that H2B ubiquitination was observed to enhance MLL1 activity [37], since the interactions with ubiquitin observed in binding mode 1 cannot occur in binding mode 2 [37]. Additional mutagenesis experiments comparing the effects of MLL1 mutations on H2Bub-modified versus unmodified nucleosomes will be needed to determine the degree to which each binding mode contributes to overall MLL1 activity.
In previous MLL1 structures, neither DPY30 nor the ASH2L C terminal region could be fully resolved [35,36]. An NMR study [40] recently revealed that DPY30 induces conformational changes in ASH2L in the MLL1 complex. To evaluate the structural importance of DPY30, the authors [40] also determined the cryo-EM structure of the MLL1 complex without DPY30 on an unmodified nucleosome (Figure 2C). The ASH2L C-terminal region displayed significantly more conformational heterogeneity when bound to nucleosomes in the absence of DPY30, suggesting that DPY30 stabilizes ASH2L

interactions with the nucleosome. This finding helps to explain why DPY30 and the C- terminal region of ASH2L are required for MLL1 activity [40].
Further insights into the structure of ASH2L and DPY30 on H2Bub-modified nucleosomes came from a recent study [41] that combined cryo-EM, crosslinking mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics flexible fitting to model both ASH2L and DPY30 into a cryo-EM map of an MLL1 complex bound to an H2Bub-modified nucleosome [41]. DPY30 formed multiple contacts with ASH2L’s C-terminal region, helping to stabilize ASH2L’s folding and placing it in proximity to nucleosomal DNA (Figure 2D) [41]. This positioning of DPY30 and ASH2L may stabilize the MLL1 complex on the nucleosome, helping explain previous reports that DPY30 increases methyltransferase activity of MLL1, and that this increase is dependent on C-terminal residues of ASH2L [35,40,41]. The study also found multiple assembly states of the MLL1 complex that all contained the ubiquitin-interacting subunit, RBBP5, suggesting that ubiquitin could possibly play a role in nucleating complex assembly.
New modes of regulating Dot1/DOT1L methyltransferases
DOT1L, a non-SET domain methyltransferase that is conserved from yeast to humans, is stimulated by ubiquitination of histone H2BK120 to methylate H3K79, a mark essential for both embryogenesis and hematopoiesis [43–45]. Like H3K4 methylation, H3K79 methylation is strongly associated with active gene transcription [46], although the mechanism by which the latter stimulates transcription is not known. As with MLL1/ COMPASS, ubiquitination of H2B does not increase DOT1L affinity for nucleosomes but instead increases DOT1L catalytic efficiency [47]. Several previous structures of the human DOT1L catalytic domain bound to H2Bub-modified nucleosomes revealed how DOT1L facilitates crosstalk between H2Bub and H3K79 methylation [48–52]. In brief, contacts with ubiquitin anchor one end of DOT1L to the nucleosome surface, allowing it to alternate between two orientation on the nucleosome: poised and active. While the poised conformation places the DOT1L active site above and out of reach of H3K79, the active state places the DOT1L catalytic site and the methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine, in close proximity to H3K79. In this active conformation, the interactions of both DOT1L and the histone H4 tail with histone H3 promote a conformational change in the globular core of H3 that inserts K79 into the DOT1L active site [48].
The activity of the yeast homologue, Dot1, had previously been linked to acetylation of histone H4K16 (H4K16ac), which is adjacent to H4 tail residues R17 and R19 that play critical roles in inducing the histone H3 conformational change [48]. Deletion of the H4K16 acetyltransferase results in lower Dot1 activity in vivo and reduced binding of Dot1 to unacetylated H4 tail peptides [53]. The basis for this additional layer of crosstalk was revealed in a recent paper reporting cryo-EM structures of yeast Dot1 bound to H2Bub-modified nucleosomes both with and without the H4K16ac modifications (Figure 3A). Whereas both poised and active orientations of Dot1 were observed when H4K16 was not acetylated, only the active conformation of Dot1 was observed on nucleosomes containing acetylated H4K16. This observation suggests that H4K16ac further promotes the

catalytically active conformation, which could account for the observed increase in activity [48,54].
In contrast to the canonical use of H2Bub to stimulate DOT1L through direct interactions, a recent report points to indirect crosstalk between ubiquitination and methylation. It had been shown that ubiquitination of histone H2BK34 (H2BK34ub) stimulates both H3K4 and H3K79 methylation [55,56]. Recently, Ai et al. [57] determined the cryo-EM structure of DOT1L bound to H2BK34ub-modified nucleosomes (Figure 2B) [57]. Although the ubiquitin conjugated to H2BK34 was located between the DNA gyres, far from DOT1L, the enzyme still adopted the active state conformation [57]. A comparison of modified and unmodified nucleosomes revealed that the ubiquitin induces a small distortion in the DNA that could promote a restructuring of the H3K79 loop that is necessary for methylation by DOT1L active site active state conformation [57]. The model is supported by molecular dynamics simulations and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments [57]. It will be interesting to see whether the same mechanism can account for the effect of H2BK34ub on H3K4 methylation [55].
Future perspectives
Histone modification crosstalk is an integral component of methyltransferase regulation, with ubiquitin playing a central role (Figure 4). The structures that have been reported in the past five years have provided tremendous insights into the mechanisms underlying this crosstalk. Beyond expanding our understanding of these fundamental molecular machines, these recent advances create a foundation for developing novel therapeutics. In particular, MLL1, DOT1L, and PRC2 play central roles in numerous malignancies and are actively pursued as therapeutic targets [34,58,59]. As we continue to expand our understanding of chromatin modifying enzymes, we may find new ways to utilize this knowledge for our own therapeutic benefit.
The advent of the “resolution revolution” in cryo-EM greatly accelerated the pace at which structures of nucleosome-bound proteins could be determined, as well as dramatically increasing the size and complexity of transcription complexes that can be visualized. An important next step will be elucidating structures of more complete chromatin-modifying complexes. Most structures reported to date contain truncated proteins or lack one or more subunits. Disordered proteins and flexible regions are often removed from the construct prior to structure determination to improve protein stability. DOT1L, for example, is a ~1500 residue protein that forms complexes with additional partner proteins such as AF4 and AF9 [60], yet all structures to date contain just the first ~400 residues [48–52,54]. MLL1 is a huge protein of almost 4,000 residues, of which only ~250 C-terminal residues are contained in the complexes studied to date. This truncation omits MLL1 residues known to interact with MENIN and LEDGF, which also bind to nucleosomes and are central MLL1 activity in vivo [61]. Another advance we can expect to see is an increase in structures of chromatin-modifying complexes bound to complex chromatin substrates that more closely resemble what the enzymes encounter in cells, rather than mononucleosomes. A first step in this direction was found in a structure of PRC2 bound to a dinucleosome that was reported in 2018 [62].

The increase in the number and complexity of histone-modifying enzyme structures has occurred in parallel with stunning advances in a mechanistic understanding of other aspects of transcription. These include structures of transcribing RNA polymerase associated with transcription initiation factors and the Mediator complex [63,64] and of transcriptional regulators bound to specific DNA sequences in their nucleosomal context [65]. It is exciting to contemplate the next step, in which these components are brought together to visualize the coordination of each step n transcription activation and repression.
